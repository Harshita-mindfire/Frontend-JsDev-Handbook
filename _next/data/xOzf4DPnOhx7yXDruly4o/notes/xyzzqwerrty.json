Then over the years the walls become weathered, the wood splinters here and there, and you start to love that house not so much because of all its perfection, but rather for its imperfections. You get to know all the nooks and crannies. How to avoid getting the key caught in the lock when it's cold outside. Which of the floorboards flex slightly when one steps on them or exactly how to open the wardrobe doors without them creaking. These are the little secrets that make it your home.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the great motivations for living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we live harder, more obstinately, with more fury. Some need its constant presence to even be aware of its antithesis. Others become so preoccupied with it that they go into the waiting room long before it has announced its arrival. We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And time is a curious thing. Most of us only live for the time that lies right ahead of us. A few days, weeks, years. One of the most painful moments in a person's life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead. And when time no longer lies ahead of one, other things have to be lived for. Memories, perhaps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But sorrow is unreliable in that way. When people don‚Äôt share it there‚Äôs a good chance that it will drive them apart instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They say the best men are born out of their faults and that they often improve later on, more than if they'd never done anything wrong.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sorrow and loss are constant, but if we all had to go through our whole lives carrying them the whole time, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to stand it. The sadness would paralyze us. So in the end we just pack it into bags and find somewhere to leave it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>She often said that ‚Äúall roads lead to something you were always predestined to do.‚Äù And for her, perhaps, it was something.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But for Ove it was someone.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>So there were certainly people who thought that feelings could not be judged by looking at cars. But they were wrong.</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"dlb5bmx7v8f6otsgongz4vx","title":"Hi","desc":"","updated":1663067414354,"created":1648190029829,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Harshita-notes","sync":"sync"},"contentHash":"5e58da66991a53ed4cf17d0cade77fe6","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"dlb5bmx7v8f6otsgongz4vx","vaultName":"Harshita-notes"},"value":"user.tharshita13","alias":"@tharshita13","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":12,"offset":433},"end":{"line":15,"column":24,"offset":445},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"user.tharshita13"}}],"anchors":{"contacts":{"type":"header","text":"Contacts","value":"contacts","line":13,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["trkx8xrg7g2fm023ez4ldqj","c8csxid3zoghxorepwcrami","urj8q1uq98o3upmgbt2qxns","ykyv5ng8vb44dx8wlchugby","qfxhhwhykm8ml24xxlu67v3","fmv0zz06pgij3bozzx9zes9"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi,\nWelcome to Harshita's Digital Garden üå±\nI'm Harshita Joshi.
