I loved every single chapter. The storytelling is excellent, beautifully crafted, engaging, and filled with just the right amount of drama to portray Ravan as the perfect villain. The love angle of Vedavati, heartbreak, loss, the brotherly obligations, anger, destruction, it all made sense. Each character is a hero in their own right. Really loved how the author made complete circle with Samichi's entry, the connection between vishwamitra -ravan and ravan-sita</p>\n<h2 id=\"phrases-i-liked\">Phrases I liked<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#phrases-i-liked\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The tale of lion and the deer. pg 156.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Kumbhkaran swallowed a lump in his throat. He had read somewhere that there was nothing worse than unrequited love. But they were wrong. There was something worse: Unrequited love that was not even aware of it being one-sided.</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a typical case of unrequited love, at least the person experiencing it is aware of the lack of reciprocation. They may feel heartbroken or disappointed, but they have the clarity of knowing that their love is not returned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, in the above scenario, the person remains oblivious to the fact that their affection is not reciprocated. They continue to harbor feelings for someone who does not feel the same way, and they may invest their emotions, time, and energy in a one-sided pursuit. The added anguish comes from the lack of awareness, as they may hold onto hope or continue to invest emotionally without realizing that their love is unrequited. In this case, the pain may be prolonged, and it can be more difficult to move on or find closure.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"dlb5bmx7v8f6otsgongz4vx","title":"Hi","desc":"","updated":1663067414354,"created":1648190029829,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Harshita-notes","sync":"sync"},"contentHash":"5e58da66991a53ed4cf17d0cade77fe6","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"dlb5bmx7v8f6otsgongz4vx","vaultName":"Harshita-notes"},"value":"user.tharshita13","alias":"@tharshita13","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":12,"offset":433},"end":{"line":15,"column":24,"offset":445},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"user.tharshita13"}}],"anchors":{"contacts":{"type":"header","text":"Contacts","value":"contacts","line":13,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["trkx8xrg7g2fm023ez4ldqj","c8csxid3zoghxorepwcrami","urj8q1uq98o3upmgbt2qxns","ykyv5ng8vb44dx8wlchugby","qfxhhwhykm8ml24xxlu67v3","fmv0zz06pgij3bozzx9zes9"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi,\nWelcome to Harshita's Digital Garden ðŸŒ±\nI'm Harshita Joshi.
