The protagonist, Billy Dunne, is the lead singer of the band, and he strives to maintain sobriety since the birth of his first child. He and his wife Camila has a different level of trust which to be honest I found faulty.</p>\n<p>Daisy Jones is the female protagonist, a wealthy, beautiful, and talented singer-songwriter. She is also a drug addict, frequently consuming pills. After collaborating on a hit song called \"Honeycomb\" with The Six, she officially joins the band. As they continue writing songs together, Billy and Daisy develop feelings for each other, although they resist acting upon them, creating tension within the dynamic of the band. Despite the challenges, the band progresses and achieves success, becoming the number one rock band.</p>\n<p>However, just as they reach the pinnacle of their career, the band decides to part ways for the greater good. Each member goes on their own path and ultimately finds happiness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"comments\">Comments<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#comments\"></a></h2>\n<p>The book is engaging and can be devoured overnight. The unique style of presenting the story as an interview, juggling narratives from band members, crew, and everyone involved, adds to its appeal. While I may have not fully grasped the intricacies of trust and love between Billy and his wife Camila, it is still a satisfying read for a Friday night.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that there is also a TV series adaptation of the book available on Prime. I skimmed through it but didn't find it particularly enjoyable.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"dlb5bmx7v8f6otsgongz4vx","title":"Hi","desc":"","updated":1663067414354,"created":1648190029829,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Harshita-notes","sync":"sync"},"contentHash":"5e58da66991a53ed4cf17d0cade77fe6","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"dlb5bmx7v8f6otsgongz4vx","vaultName":"Harshita-notes"},"value":"user.tharshita13","alias":"@tharshita13","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":12,"offset":433},"end":{"line":15,"column":24,"offset":445},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"user.tharshita13"}}],"anchors":{"contacts":{"type":"header","text":"Contacts","value":"contacts","line":13,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["trkx8xrg7g2fm023ez4ldqj","c8csxid3zoghxorepwcrami","urj8q1uq98o3upmgbt2qxns","ykyv5ng8vb44dx8wlchugby","qfxhhwhykm8ml24xxlu67v3","fmv0zz06pgij3bozzx9zes9"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nHi,\nWelcome to Harshita's Digital Garden ðŸŒ±\nI'm Harshita Joshi.
