## Comments

This is one of the best novels I have read recently. Initially it took me some time to get onboard. The frequent _sanskrit_ names and references and a better vocabulary requirement kept me from turning pages but as I moved on from my inertia of reading thrillers, I fell in love with the narration. It torches light on why do we workship who we worship. Ram is an ideal man, it is very inherent to be practical or you know just stupid, but to be ideal is something that requires both courage and sacrifice. ^dxpub7hs2rel
P.S. Sita is the best part of novel.

## Fav quotes

- sanskrit language: _Kimapi Nu Janaahaa Vadishyanti. Tadeva Kaaryam Janaanaam_

- Dashrath continued, _I blamed you for my defeat. You suffered all your life, and yet you never rebelled. I thought it was because you were weak. `But weak people celebrate when twists of fate hurt their tormentors`. And yet you risked your life to protect me_

- If a tactic has lead to failure, then persisting with it unquesttioningly in the wild hope of a different outcome, is nothing short of insanity.

- Emperor Prithu had spoken of the ideal human archetype of the _aryaputra_, a gentleman, and the _aryaputri_, a lady, a prototypical human partnership of two strong individuals, who didn't compete for exact equality but were complimentary, completing each other. Two souls that were dependent on each other, giving each other purpose; `two halves of a whole`
