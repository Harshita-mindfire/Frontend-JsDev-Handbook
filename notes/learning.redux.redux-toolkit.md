## Redux
- predictable state container for js apps.
- predictable because in redux, a pattern is enforced to ensure all transitions are explicit and can be tracked.

Redux toolkit serves as an abstraction over redux. It gives good DX and eradicates the need for a lot of boiler plate code.

- React-redux is a lib that provides bindings to use React and redux(toolkit) together in an application.
