Hi,
Welcome to Harshita's Digital Garden ðŸŒ±
I'm Harshita Joshi. I'm a software engineer who also has a passion for teaching.
When not at the computer, I play ukulele, do yoga, study [German](https://harshita-mindfire.github.io/german-for-beginners/), sing the worst cover of `Shallow` by Lady Gaga and wonder about having numerous pets.

Even though I don't travel very often, I try to capture the city's charm through photographs. Click [here](https://harshita-mindfire.github.io/) to see a glimpse of my gallery.
