## Pre-requisite
[[Gen AI | learning.gen-ai]]

## What are LLMs
- Large language models.
- advanced AI models, trained on large datasets.
- can understand, generate and process natural language
- stateless. each transaction is independent.

## HOW LLM works
- Transformer architecture: core of LLM
- uses self attention ton process text.
- use training method called self supervised learning

**Tokenization**

- breaks text into tokens(samller, amageable picees)

**Text generation**
LLms generate one word or token at a time, predicting thr next word or (token) in a sentence.
- constantly adjusting its predictions based on the context.
