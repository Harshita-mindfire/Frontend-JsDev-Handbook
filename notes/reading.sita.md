## Comments

I thoroughly enjoyed reading the second book in the Ram Chandra Series by Amish. It beautifully crafted a vivid and powerful portrayal of Sita. She exhibited remarkable intelligence, unwavering determination, and an indomitable warrior spirit. Along her journey, she formed deep bonds with loyal friends who I believe will stand by her side until the series concludes. Sita possesses unwavering clarity regarding her purpose and priorities. This book successfully maintains the series' core themes of strength, wisdom, choice, love, and self-discovery.

Furthermore, this book delves deeply into the enigmatic secrets that remained unresolved from the first installment. The Malayaputras have designated Sita as the next Vishnu, and it is revealed that Vishwamitra, the leader of the Malayaputras and Sita's guru, deliberately orchestrated Ram's use of the devi astra against the Lankans. While there are still untold stories awaiting us, such as the rivalry between Divodas and Kaushik and the connection between Vishwamitra and Ravan, this book remains a compelling and captivating read.

## Favorite quotes
