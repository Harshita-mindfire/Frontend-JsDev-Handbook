Typescript's type system helps us during development.
The key difference b/w JS and TS type system is JS uses dynamic types(resolves during runtime) and TS uses static types(set during development)

## Core Types
- number: All numbers, no differentiation b/w integers and floats.
- string
- boolean

**Note**: The core primitive types in TypeScript are all lowercase!
