## Top picks

1. use semantic HTML. It has a lot built in capabilities like responding to focus, tab and enter.
2. Correct heading order, h1 first then h2 etc. Don't use headings for styling purpose(use `<strong>`, css or other approaches)
3. don't use anchor tags for buttons(like in hamburger menus). a tags without href is almost next to nothing. screen reader will read it as a normal text. 

## Screen readers

- If you're on a Windows machine and would like to get started with screen readers, NVDA is a great option.
