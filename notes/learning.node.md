- JS runtime(not a language or framework)
- Built on chrome's V8 engine
- allows us to use Js as a server side language

## Why node
- fast
- event driven, non-blocking I/o model

## Non Blocking I/O
- single threaded using non-blocking I/o Calls
- supports tens of thousand concurrent calls with the help of event loop

__DON'T USE NODE FOR CPU INTENSIVE APPS__

## Core node modules
- path, fs, http, os etc
