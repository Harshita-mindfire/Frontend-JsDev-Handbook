## Basics

**Note**: 

- **/ is true division**. In Python, / always returns a float, even when the math result is a whole number.

```py
4 / 2
```
>➡️ 2.0

Why?
Python 3 defines / as true division.

Result is always **float**.

- **// is floor division**

// returns the quotient rounded down.
```py
4 // 2
```
>➡️ 2

Why is it an int here?

Both operands are integers. Result is an integer

But watch this:
```py
4.0 // 2
```
>➡️ 2.0

and:
```py
4 // 2.0
```
>➡️ 2.0

So again:

**If any operand is float → result is float**
