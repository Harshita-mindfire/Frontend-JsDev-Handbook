## 4. Experiment

- gain validated learning
- take initial steps like we perform a science experiment
    - have a hypothesis
    - make calculated prediction in theory
    - perform
- begin small experiments immediately
    - break it down and calculate value and growth hypothesis(value hypothesis is if the new feature/product adds alue to customer? growth hypothesis describes the growth of feature/product after shipping it.)
    - an experiment is a product. Instead of manager asking engineer to build certain requirements. The lean startup encourages team to answer these questions:
        a. Do customer release it is a problem which you aim to solve?
        b. If there was a solution, will it increase growth?
        c. can we build the solution ?

_success is not delivering feature; success is learning how to solve customer's problem_
