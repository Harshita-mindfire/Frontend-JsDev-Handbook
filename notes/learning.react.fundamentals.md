## React

A JS library for building User interfaces.

- uses Virtual DOM
- unindirectional data flow
- reusable UI components

## component

a fuction that returns markup

## Functional components over Class

- use functional comp over class, after 16.8 hooks can be used as lifecycle events.
- use class component when you want a react functionality that is not availabke for functions yet, eg: error boundries
- Only class components can be error boundaries. To make class component an error boundary we define a new lifecycle method called componentDidCatch(error, info).

ReactDOM.render function: takes 2 i/p

- App
- document.getElementById("root")

## JSX

you can use the conditional ? operator. it works inside JSX:

```js
<div>{isLoggedIn ? <AdminPanel /> : <LoginForm />}</div>
```

When you donâ€™t need the else branch, you can also use a shorter logical && syntax:

```js
<div>{isLoggedIn && <AdminPanel />}</div>
```

## Pure components

Some JavaScript functions are pure. A pure function:

- Minds its own business. It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.
- Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.

## React State vs Props

- State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
- props are inputs to a component, They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.

Both props and state are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.
