Nonetheless, the initial chapters shine with their skillfully crafted conversations among Ravan, Sita, and Kumbhkaran.\n\nAs the narrative unfolds, we discover that Sita is, indeed, Vedavati's daughter, a suspicion I had entertained to some extent. Vishwamitra, already aware of this revelation, devises additional strategies that may be explored in potential spin-offs. However, the book would have benefited from trimming at least 100 pages as it suffers from pacing issues, leading to significant lag.\n\nA notable flaw is the sudden shift in Ravan's portrayal. Previously established as a prominent villain throughout the preceding three books, his reduced significance following the mere mention of Vedavati lacks depth and leaves the reader wanting more in terms of character development and consistency. It was difficult to comprehend the abrupt change of heart considering that he already knew Vedavati was deceased.\n","n":0.081}}},{"i":15,"$":{"0":{"v":"The Seven Husband of Evelyn Hugo","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n## Summary \n\nThe life of `Evelyn Hugo` is filled with scandal and fame. Over the course of her lifetime, she was married eight times to seven different husbands. Eighth time the charm, she secretly married the love of her life `Celia St James`, also an Oscar-winning actress. In an era prior to the acceptance of bisexuality, she was a bisexual. As she says herself, `I spent half my time loving her and half hiding how much I loved her.`. Evelyn, like any other human, made mistakes along the way. Although some of them were unforgivable, she believed she did what had to be done for her survival. She was suffering from `Breast Cancer` during her last days and wanted to come out of closet through her biography. She chose `Monique`, a struggling writer for `Vivane`(magazine) for writing her biography. A curious Monique wondered why Evelyn Hugo had chosen her out of all the writers. Evelyn asked Monique to justify her true character in the book. It was not in her interest to whitewash her actions. \n\n### Marriages\n- She married `Ernie Diaz` to get out of her depressing town where her father treated her like trash.\n- Fell in love with superstar `Don Adler`, became a victim of #domestic-violence, divorced.\n- Went to LA and married `Mick Riva` for a day to stop spreading any rumours about her and Celia.\n- Married `Rex North` as a publicity stunt to get TRP for upcoming movie.\n- Married her best-friend `Harry Cameron`(gay) to start a family of her own.\n- Fell in love with her director `Max Girard` divorced soon after she received a hint from Celia on getting back together.\n- Married `Robert Jamison`, Celia's brother to settle with Celia in Europe.\n- Married `Celia` in her bedroom. Celia suffered from a disease, died few years after.\n\n\n## Takeaways\n\n- `When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen.

It beautifully crafted a vivid and powerful portrayal of Sita. She exhibited remarkable intelligence, unwavering determination, and an indomitable warrior spirit. Along her journey, she formed deep bonds with loyal friends who I believe will stand by her side until the series concludes. Sita possesses unwavering clarity regarding her purpose and priorities. This book successfully maintains the series' core themes of strength, wisdom, choice, love, and self-discovery.\n\nFurthermore, this book delves deeply into the enigmatic secrets that remained unresolved from the first installment. The Malayaputras have designated Sita as the next Vishnu, and it is revealed that Vishwamitra, the leader of the Malayaputras and Sita's guru, deliberately orchestrated Ram's use of the devi astra against the Lankans. While there are still untold stories awaiting us, such as the rivalry between Divodas and Kaushik and the connection between Vishwamitra and Ravan, this book remains a compelling and captivating read.\n\n## Favorite quotes\n\n- The entire anecdote about `the death of the matriarch of a large elephant herd`. Wonderful narration. pg no 96 onwards.\n- Hanuman: _better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all_\n  Sita: _Forgive me, I don't mean to be rude but only someone who has never loved at all can say something like that_.\n\n## vocab\n\n- matriarch: a woman who is the head of a family or tribe.\n  > \"in some cultures the mother proceeds to the status of a matriarch\"\n- beseech: ask someone urgently to do something.\n  > He cast a beseeching look at his sister, begging for her help.\n","n":0.061}}},{"i":18,"$":{"0":{"v":"Ravan: Enemy of Aryawarta","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n## Comments\n\nThis is the best book of the series. I loved every single chapter. The storytelling is excellent, beautifully crafted, engaging, and filled with just the right amount of drama to portray Ravan as the perfect villain. The love angle of Vedavati, heartbreak, loss, the brotherly obligations, anger, destruction, it all made sense. Each character is a hero in their own right. Really loved how the author made complete circle with Samichi's entry, the connection between vishwamitra -ravan and ravan-sita\n\n## Phrases I liked\n\n- The tale of lion and the deer. pg 156.\n\n- _Kumbhkaran swallowed a lump in his throat. He had read somewhere that there was nothing worse than unrequited love. But they were wrong. There was something worse: Unrequited love that was not even aware of it being one-sided._\n\n> In a typical case of unrequited love, at least the person experiencing it is aware of the lack of reciprocation. They may feel heartbroken or disappointed, but they have the clarity of knowing that their love is not returned.\n\nHowever, in the above scenario, the person remains oblivious to the fact that their affection is not reciprocated. They continue to harbor feelings for someone who does not feel the same way, and they may invest their emotions, time, and energy in a one-sided pursuit. The added anguish comes from the lack of awareness, as they may hold onto hope or continue to invest emotionally without realizing that their love is unrequited. In this case, the pain may be prolonged, and it can be more difficult to move on or find closure.\n","n":0.062}}},{"i":19,"$":{"0":{"v":"Ram: scion of ikshvaku","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n## Comments\n\nThis is one of the best novels I have read recently.

He and his wife Camila has a different level of trust which to be honest I found faulty.\n\nDaisy Jones is the female protagonist, a wealthy, beautiful, and talented singer-songwriter. She is also a drug addict, frequently consuming pills. After collaborating on a hit song called \"Honeycomb\" with The Six, she officially joins the band. As they continue writing songs together, Billy and Daisy develop feelings for each other, although they resist acting upon them, creating tension within the dynamic of the band. Despite the challenges, the band progresses and achieves success, becoming the number one rock band.\n\nHowever, just as they reach the pinnacle of their career, the band decides to part ways for the greater good. Each member goes on their own path and ultimately finds happiness.\n\n## Comments\n\nThe book is engaging and can be devoured overnight. The unique style of presenting the story as an interview, juggling narratives from band members, crew, and everyone involved, adds to its appeal. While I may have not fully grasped the intricacies of trust and love between Billy and his wife Camila, it is still a satisfying read for a Friday night.\n\nIt's worth noting that there is also a TV series adaptation of the book available on Prime.

The book beautifully portrays the extraordinary in the ordinary, making even the mundane tasks come alive with the author's incredible writing style. Each chapter presents a unique perspective on life, delving into themes of loss, sorrow, and ultimately, hope.\n\nAs the story unfolds, readers are taken on a journey through Ove's past, gradually unraveling the reasons behind his seemingly cold demeanor. Through his encounters with neighbors and unexpected friendships, Ove's character undergoes a transformation, revealing his hidden depths and warmth.\n\nThe narrative skillfully weaves together past and present, creating a full circle of emotions and experiences. Certain phrases and motifs recur throughout the book, adding layers of meaning with each repetition and enhancing the reader's understanding of Ove's complex persona.\n\nThis is probably the best book that I read recently.\n\n## Quotes/Phrases I liked\n\n- Loving someone is like moving into a house,\" Sonja used to say. \"At first you fall in love with all the new things, amazed every morning that all this belongs to you, as if fearing that someone would suddenly come rushing in through the door to explain that a terrible mistake had been made, you weren't actually supposed to live in a wonderful place like this. Then over the years the walls become weathered, the wood splinters here and there, and you start to love that house not so much because of all its perfection, but rather for its imperfections. You get to know all the nooks and crannies. How to avoid getting the key caught in the lock when it's cold outside. Which of the floorboards flex slightly when one steps on them or exactly how to open the wardrobe doors without them creaking. These are the little secrets that make it your home.\n\n- Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the great motivations for living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we live harder, more obstinately, with more fury. Some need its constant presence to even be aware of its antithesis. Others become so preoccupied with it that they go into the waiting room long before it has announced its arrival. We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.\n\n- And time is a curious thing. Most of us only live for the time that lies right ahead of us. A few days, weeks, years. One of the most painful moments in a person's life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead. And when time no longer lies ahead of one, other things have to be lived for. Memories, perhaps.\n\n- But sorrow is unreliable in that way. When people don’t share it there’s a good chance that it will drive them apart instead.\n\n- They say the best men are born out of their faults and that they often improve later on, more than if they'd never done anything wrong.\n\n- Sorrow and loss are constant, but if we all had to go through our whole lives carrying them the whole time, we wouldn’t be able to stand it. The sadness would paralyze us.

All routes must be inside app folder.\n1. Each folder represents a segment of URL path.\n1. Routes files must be named either page.js or page.tsx\n1. 404 routes are handled by default.\n\n- Every page in app router receives route parameters through [[params | learning.nextjs.routing.Link#params]] prop. The type of params is a promise that resolves to an obj containing dynamic segments as key value pairs.\n\n\nWhen these conventions are followed, route file automatically becomes available as a route.\n\n- similarly for nested routes: \n\n![](/assets/images/nested-routes.png)\n\n## Dynamic routes\n\n- folder with name wrapped around with sqaure brackets [ ].\n\n```figma\n- app\n    - products\n        - page.tsx\n        - [productId]\n            - page.tsx\n    - page.tsx\n\n```\n\n- to now get the segment from http://localhost:3000/products/1\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nconst ProductDetails = async ({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ productId: string }>;\n}) => {\n  const productId = (await params).productId;\n  return <div>Product details: {productId}</div>;\n};\n\nexport default ProductDetails;\n```\n\n### Nested dynamic routes\n\n![](/assets/images/routes.png)\n\n### Catch all segments\n\n- Dynamic Segments can be extended to catch-all subsequent segments by adding an ellipsis inside the brackets [...segmentName].\n\n```figma\n- shop\n  - [...slug]\n    - page.tsx\n```\n\n\n\nFor example, /shop/[...slug].js will match /shop/clothes, but also /shop/clothes/tops, /shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts, and so on.\n\nRoute\tExample URL\tparams\n- /shop/[...slug].js\t/shop/a\t{ slug: ['a'] }\n- /shop/[...slug].js\t/shop/a/b\t{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }\n- /shop/[...slug].js\t/shop/a/b/c\t{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }\n\n- To make the slugs optional, wrap the slug in double square brackets \"[[]]\"\n\n- `/shop/[[...slug]].js`\t/shop\t{ slug: undefined }\n\nFor example if you would try to access just the /shop, it would result in 404. To use the same page.tsx inside slug and also to make slugs optional, we can do the following:\n```figma\n- shop\n  - [[...slug]]\n    - page.tsx\n```\n\n## custom 404\n- not-found.tsx\n```tsx \nexport default function NotFound() {\n  return <h1> custom 404 page <>/h1>\n}\n```\nThe file with this route gets called automatically on 404. We can also explicitally call this as a func as well.\n\n**NOTE**: **NotFound component does not accept any props**\nUse `usePathname` from `next/navigation` hook to access the url segments.\n\n```tsx\nconst pathname = usePathname()\n\n```\n\n**NOTE** _To use usePathname() hook, the component must be a client component, hence add \"use-client\" directive at the top of the page._\n\n\n\nLet's say we want to call 404 page if the review id is > 100 (eg: /products/1/reviews/1000 )\n\n```tsx\nimport {notFound } from \"next/navigation;\n\nexport default async function ProductReview({params} : {params: Promise<{productId: string; reviewId: string}>}) {\n  const { reviewId} = await params;\n  if(parseInt(reviewId) > 100) {\n    notFound()\n  }\n  return <h1> Review no {reviewId} of {productId} </h1>\n} \n```\n\n\n## Private folders\n\n- starts with underscore _\n- the folder and its sub folders are excluded from routing.\n\n### uses\n- separating UI logic from routing logic\n- consistent way to organize internal files.\n\n## Route groups\n- logically organize our routes and project files without impacting the URL structure.\n- only way to share layouts between routes without affecting the URL.\n- also helps us to apply routes selectively to specific parts of app(multiple root layout)\n\n_the folder wrapped in () tells nextjs to use this as an organizational tool only and exclude it from the url.

It allows us to have prefix/suffix. \nfor eg, if the layout.tsx has the following metadata\n```tsx\n  export const metadata = {\n  title: {\n    default: \"Next.js Tutorial\",\n    template: \"%s | ByteSizedFrontend\"\n  }\n};\n```\n\nNow if the children page has title metadata = \"Routing\", the title in the actual page metadata will come as: `Routing | ByteSizedFrontend`\n\n- **absolute**: to breakthrough the template, use absolute in children route metadata\nfor eg, if the layout metadata remains same as above and I have the child page.tsx as:\n```tsx\n  export const metadata = {\n  title: {\n    absolute: \"Routing example\"\n  }\n};\n```\nThe final title would appear as `Routing example`.\n","n":0.052}}},{"i":43,"$":{"0":{"v":"Loading UI","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nThis file helps us create loading states that users see while waiting for content to load in a specefic route segment.\n\n- appears instantly\n- add loading.tsx\n","n":0.2}}},{"i":44,"$":{"0":{"v":"Layouts","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Pages are route specific UI components\n- Layouts is a UI that is shared between multiple pages in your app like header, footer etc.\n\n## Creation\n- default export a react component from `layout.tsx` file.\n- takes a children prop populated with page content.\n\neg: root layout. any structure in here goes to all the pages.\nThe children prop changes based on the route accessed.\n```tsx\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <header\n          style={{\n            backgroundColor: \"#f4f9f7\",\n            textAlign: \"center\",\n            padding: \"1rem\",\n          }}\n        >\n          Header\n        </header>\n        {children}\n        <footer\n          style={{\n            backgroundColor: \"ghostwhite\",\n            textAlign: \"center\",\n            padding: \"1rem\",\n          }}\n        >\n          Footer\n        </footer>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n\n\n```\n\n## Nested Layout\nlayout.tsx inside a route is specific for that route.\n\n## Multiple root layout.\nIf we want let say 2 of our route to have one layout and all the others to have another, we would require multiple root layouts,\nfor this, we take help of router groups.\n\nEg: we need only footer for login and register route, for customers, we want both header and footer.\n\n```figma\n- app\n  - (auth)\n    - login\n      - page.tsx\n    - register\n      - page.tsx\n    layout.tsx //AuthRootLayout\n  - (marketing)\n    - customers\n      - page.tsx\n    - suppliers\n      - page.tsx\n    - page.tsx //global entry page\n    - layout.tsx //MarketingRootLayout\n```\n\n\n\n## Handling errors\n- ![[learning.nextjs.routing.error-handling#handling-errors-in-layouts]]\n\n\n","n":0.071}}},{"i":45,"$":{"0":{"v":"Error Handling","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"- are **client components**\n- error.tsx file\n- receives error and reset prop.\n- error is of type Error and reset is a function that attempts to retry rendering the component.\n- enables you to attempt to recover from from an error without requirring a full page review.\n\n![](/assets/images/component-hierarchy.png)\n\n```tsx\n\"use client\";\nimport { useRouter } from \"next/navigation\";\nimport { startTransition } from \"react\";\n\nconst ErrorBoundary = ({\n  error,\n  reset,\n}: {\n  error: Error;\n  reset: () => void;\n}) => {\n  const router = useRouter();\n  const reload = () => {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      router.refresh();\n      reset();\n    });\n  };\n  return (\n    <div>\n      Error is: {error.message}\n      <button onClick={reload}>Try again</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ErrorBoundary;\n\n\n```\n\n## Handling errors in layouts\n- The error boundary won't catch error thrown in layout.tsx within the same segment(in the same folder) because of the component rendering hierarchy.\n- layout sits above the error boundry in the component tree.\n- to resolve, move the error boundry at the parent of layout.\n\nSo how do we handle errors that are thrown from root layout?

But with CSR, the page source is basically an empty div.

Static Site Generation (SSG)\n \n2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\n \nSSG happens during build time when you deploy your application to the server. This results in pages that are already rendered and ready to serve. It's perfect for content that stays relatively stable, like blog posts\n \nSSR, on the other hand, renders pages on-demand when users request them. It's ideal for personalized content like social media feeds where the HTML changes based on who's logged in.\n\n### Hydration\n(react adding interactivity to the server rendered HTML)\n \nDuring hydration, React takes control in the browser and reconstructs the component tree in memory, using the server-rendered HTML as a blueprint\n \nIt carefully maps out where all the interactive elements should go, then hooks up the JavaScript logic\n \nThis involves initializing application state, adding click and mouseover handlers, and setting up all the dynamic features needed for a full interactive user experience.\n\n### Drawbacks of SSR\n \n- **You have to fetch everything before you can show anything**\n \nComponents cannot start rendering and then pause or \"wait\" while data is still being loaded\n \nIf a component needs to fetch data from a database or another source (like an API), this fetching must be completed before the server can begin rendering the page\n \nThis can delay the server's response time to the browser, as the server must finish collecting all necessary data before any part of the page can be sent to the client\n\n- **You have to load everything before you can hydrate anything**\n \nFor successful hydration, where React adds interactivity to the server-rendered HTML, the component tree in the browser must exactly match the server-generated component tree\n \nThis means that all the JavaScript for the components must be loaded on the client before you can start hydrating any of them.\n\n- **You have to hydrate everything before you can interact with anything**\n \nReact hydrates the component tree in a single pass, meaning once it starts hydrating, it won't stop until it's finished with the entire tree\n \nAs a consequence, all components must be hydrated before you can interact with any of them.\n\n\n### Suspense SSR\n\nUse the `<Suspense>` componenet to unlock 2 major SSR features:\n- HTML streaming on server\n- Selective hydration on the client.\n\nThis solves the 3 all or nothing concerns of SSR: \n \n1. having to load the data for the entire page. \n    > React 18+ can fix this via `<Suspense>`\n \n2. loading the JavaScript for the entire page\n    > can be fixed with code splitting.\n \n3. hydrating the entire page.\n    > Suspense also allows React to let hydrate other parts of the page before the section wrapped within it is ready. This is what we call: **selective hydration**. In scenarios where multiple components are awaiting hydration, React prioritizes hydration based on user interactions\n \nat once, create an \"all or nothing\" waterfall problem that spans from the server to the client, where each issue must be resolved before moving to the next one\n \n\n### Drawbacks of suspense ssr\nraises 3 question:\n1. do user still need to download so much data(loading entire webpage bit by bit)\n2. should all components be hydrated, even those that don't need interactivity(static content components)\n3. Shouldn't we be leverging our servers more(user's device do bulk of the JS work which can slow things down)\n\n\n### React Server components\n![[learning.nextjs.rendering.react-server-components]]\n\n\n\n\n","n":0.039}}},{"i":48,"$":{"0":{"v":"React Server Components","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"**The app router in Nextjs is built entirely on RSC architecture.

This is fantastic for users with slower connections or less powerful devices since they don't need to download, parse, and execute that JavaScript.\n Plus, there's no hydration step, making your app load and become interactive faster\n- **Direct access to server-side resources**: Server Components **can talk directly to databases and file systems**, making data fetching super efficient without any client-side processing.\nThey use the server's power and proximity to data sources to manage compute-intensive rendering tasks.\n- **Enhanced security**: Since SC only run on server, sensitive data like API keys never leave the server.\n- **Improved data fetching**: since SC are closer to data source, this can improve performance by reducing time it takes to fetch data needed for rendering.\n- **Caching**: can cache the results and reuse them for different users and requests\n- **Faster initial load & FCP**: By generating HTML on the server, users see your content immediately- no waiting for JS to download and execute.\n- **Improved SEO**\n- **Efficient Streaming**: SC can split the rendering process into chunks that stream to client as they're ready. This means users start seeing content faster instead of waiting for entire page to render on the server.\n\n\nServer components handle data fetching and static rendering, client components take care of rendering the interactive elements.\n\n\n \n\n### rsc payload\n\n- these files have a special JSOn format are generated by react for each route and represent your virtual DOM in a super compavct way using abbreviations and internal references.\n- fr server components it also includes the actual rendered result.\n- CC rsc payload is a bit different,it has placeholders showing where the CC should go + refernces to their JS files\n\n\n","n":0.043}}},{"i":49,"$":{"0":{"v":"Server Rendering Strategies","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"- Static rendering\n- dynamic rendering\n- streaming\n\n# Static rendering\n \nStatic rendering is a server rendering strategy where we generate HTML pages when building our application\n \nThink of it as preparing all your content in advance - before any user visits your site\n \nOnce built, these pages can be cached by CDNs and served instantly to users\n \nWith this approach, the same pre-rendered page can be shared among different users, giving your app a significant performance boost\n\n**Usage**: blog post, e-commerce product listings, documentation(like the one you are currently reading, it is statically rendered.) \n\n## How to statically render\n- default strategy in app router. all routes are automatically prepared at build time without any additional help.\n\n## Summary\n \nStatic rendering is a server rendering strategy where we generate HTML pages when building our application\n \nThink of it as preparing all your content in advance - before any user visits your site\n \nOnce built, these pages can be cached by CDNs and served instantly to users\n \nWith this approach, the same pre-rendered page can be shared among different users, giving your app a significant performance boost\n\n# Dynamic rendering\n\n- Dynamic rendering is a strategy where the HTML is generated at request time\n \n- Next.js automatically enables it when it encounters dynamic functions like **cookies, headers, connection, draftMode, after or searchParams** prop\n \n- Dynamic rendering is great for personalized content like social media feeds\n \n- You don't have to stress about choosing between static and dynamic rendering\n \n- Next.js automatically selects the optimal rendering strategy for each route based on the features and APIs you're using\n \n- if you want to force a route to be dynamically rendered, you can use the \n```jsx\nexport const dynamic = 'force-dynamic\" config at the top of your page\n```\n\n## generateStaticParams\n\nlet you to pre-render static routes for dynamic segments.

Isn't both of them generate pages just in time? Why do we need getServerSideProps if fallback true does the exact same thing?\n\n**Answer**\n\nWhile `{fallback: true}` and `getServerSideProps` both generate pages dynamically at runtime, they have some important differences that make them better suited for different use cases.\n\nFirstly, `{fallback: true}` is typically used for generating pages for dynamic routes that have a large number of possible values, but only a small subset of those values are actually used frequently. In this case, it's not practical to pre-render all possible values at build-time because it would take too long or consume too much resources. Instead, using `{fallback: true}` allows you to pre-render only the most frequently used values at build-time, and generate the remaining pages on-demand at runtime. This can lead to faster build times and reduced resource usage.\n\nOn the other hand, `getServerSideProps` is useful when you need to generate pages that require data that can't be pre-fetched at build-time. For example, if you have a page that shows real-time data or user-specific data, you can use `getServerSideProps` to fetch the necessary data at runtime and generate the page on the server-side. This ensures that the page always shows the most up-to-date information.\n\nAdditionally, `getServerSideProps` gives you more control over the page generation process. With `{fallback: true}`, you have less control over the timing and order of page generation, and you can't do things like server-side rendering conditional content. With `getServerSideProps`, you have full control over the data fetching and rendering process, and can generate pages with more complex logic.\n\nIn summary, while `{fallback: true}` and `getServerSideProps` can both generate pages dynamically at runtime, they are better suited for different use cases. `{fallback: true}` is useful for generating pages for dynamic routes with a large number of possible values, while `getServerSideProps` is useful for generating pages that require real-time or user-specific data, or that have more complex rendering logic.\n","n":0.055}}},{"i":55,"$":{"0":{"v":"HTML","n":1}}},{"i":56,"$":{"0":{"v":"Canvas","n":1},"1":{"v":"The HTML `<canvas>` element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.\nThe `<canvas>` element is only a container for graphics.

Use threat model to prioritize what needs to be protected first. Find the weakest link and raise the security level to make the weakest point as diificult to exploit as possible.\n2. Each system is vulnerable to its own specific  attacks. There is no 'one size fits all' threat model. Create a threat model to analyze:\n    - valuables to protect\n    - vulnerability\n    - types of attack possible.\n    - re-evaluate often.\n\n\n# General Security Principles\n\n## Principle of lease privilege\n- It says, every privileged user of the system should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job. Only give as much security access to any person or group as they need, and no additional privileges.\n\n- Principle of Least-Privilege Applications:\n    - APIs\n    - System resources\n    - Database access\n    - Software version control\n    - Public-facing webpages        \n\n## Simple is more secure\n\nKeep the code simple.\n- Use clearly named functions and variables \n- Write code comments \n- Prefer built-in functions. \n- Remove cruft(redundant, unused code)\n- Disable unused features.(removing unused feature helps us to secure one feature less, i.e one less feature open to threat)\n- DRY\n\n## Deny-list Allow-list\n\nRestricting item by default is more secure approach. \nFor example: In html form certain tags are allowed whereas rest are not. If we maintain a deny-list, it will be a lot of tags, also if a new tags gets introduced, we need to make sure we update the deny list. \n\n## Defence in depth\nMulti level checkpoints like MFA, Captcha etc.\n\n### Regulating requests\n This is the first line of defence. \n - Make sure your application accepts only request methods(get, post, put etc) you expect and ignore others. \n - Also examine the request response format(Content Type and Accept).- Filter problematic IPs in the past.\n - have a cap size for file size etc.\n\n### Validating input\n Only good data is allowed in your web app. This would be different for each request but still some common areas to check are: \n - Presence/length of i/p\n - type of data (num, jpeg, pdf)\n - format(email)\n - uniqueness (no two email are same etc)\n\n### Sanitizing data\nMost languages have special characters that have a definite meaning to them. If these special characters are in the data and are not sanitized, they may use their special meaning and cause problems. \n\n- The right action would be to replace powerful characters with harmless equivalents like in  `HTML: \"<\" with \"&It;\" and \">\" with \"&gt;\"`\n- escaping characters: like in sql ' denotes start f a string. Hence: SQL: \"WHERE name='fake\\'AND 1=1--'''\n- typecasting data: Sql sanitization, JS sanitization etc\n\nData arriving directly from a user is not the only data that needs sanitization. Retrieving any stored data should be treated as new input too. For example, data may be properly sanitized for SQL when it's received and then stored in a database, but when it's retrieved from the database, it needs to be sanitized again before being used as HTML, JavaScript, JSON, XML, or any other format. It's also possible that the data changed since it was last stored. Just because it resides on your system doesn't mean you should trust it more than data coming directly from a user. You should always sanitize data before using it. \n\n### Label variables\n\nIt's important to keep track of which data has been sanitized and which has not. We can use variable names to label which data is potentially dangerous and which data is safe to use. You never want to accidentally pull in raw information, invalidating the entire sanitization process.\n- Before sanitization, we can use names such as dirty, raw, or unsafe. \n- After sanitization, we can use names such as clean, sanitized, or safe.\n\n### Keep creds private\n\n- Don't put credentials directly inside your code. We call that hard coding the credentials. Instead, store the credentials in a separate file and use variables or even better constants to refer to the values.\n- remove creds config file from version control.\n- never reuse creds.\n\n### Keep error msgs vague\nHackers use the results of their actions to improve their chances of success.\n\nImagine that a hacker visits a standard login page on a website and tries a username and password. If the response is username not found, then the hacker knows to try a different username. If after a few tries the response changes to password not found, then they'll know that they've made progress and they have found a valid username. A more secure approach is to return an identical login failed message in both cases. \n\n### Smart logging\n\nWhat to Log:\n- Date and time\n- Source (IP, user)\n- Action and target\n\nDon't log query or post params. It can log user secret infos.\nAlso don't log any internal network information – including share names, router information, and computer names – needs to be encoded or otherwise obfuscated so that they're recognizable but not a way to access or probe them via automation.\n\n\n# Most common attacks\n\n## Credential attacks\nThere's credential theft, brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing.\n\n- **credential theft**: somebody knows your credential. Maybe you shared accidently or left them somewhere.\n- **brute force**: A brute-force attack is when an attacker uses software to try every combination of characters. In order to guess a password, it is trial and error. \n- **dictionary attack**: It is also a brute force attack, but it's one which prioritizes words that are in a dictionary over random combinations. It does not change the total time required to try every combination, but it can greatly reduce the actual time required to find the correct password.  eg: Qwerty, password\n- **credential stuffing**: Once attacker knows password to one site, they try it on the other sites as well for same user. Most people have same psd for all many sites since this way it  is easier to remember.\n\n**Passwords Recommendations**\n- Use long, complex passwords\n- Never reuse a password\n- Use a password manager eg: 1pass etc\n- Use SSH keys\n- Becrypt passwords\n- Use multi-factor authentication\n\nYou can also use **Login throttling**, i.e after maybe 10 failed attempts a penalty to wait 5 mins before making next attempt.\n\n## URL manipulation and Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)\n\n- Searching for private webpages\n- Exploring the file system\n- Enumerating values in the database\n- Detecting installed software\n- Accessing privileged resources\n\nManipulating a URL may reveal a private webpage. The public website may not have a link to that page, or the page may be only accessible under certain conditions. For example, adding \"preview=true\" to a URL might show an unpublished version of the page. \n\nIf a page displays a person's contact information, when the URL contains an ID of 27, then an attacker could try all IDs to get a full list of the people in the database. \n\nSoftware on a web server sometimes includes built-in webpages with special information for administration. \n\n- https://abc.com/orders/1244 : This particular url is a Direct object reference. It is fetching details of order id 1244.

Some browsers hide text until the font loads, causing a flash of invisible text (FOIT).\n\n   - to avoid showing invisible text while custom fonts load is to temporarily show a system font. add `font-display: swap`` in your @font-face style\n\n   ```css\n   @font-face {\n     font-family: 'Pacifico';\n     src: local('Pacifico Regular'), local('Pacifico-Regular'),\n       url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/pacifico/v12/FwZY7-Qmy14u9lezJ-6H6MmBp0u-.woff2)\n         format('woff2');\n     font-display: swap;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   - swap tells the browser that text using the font should be displayed immediately using a system font. Once the custom font is ready, it replaces the system font\n\n8. **Preload key requests / Preconnect to required origins**: Declare preload links in your HTML to instruct the browser to download key resources as soon as possible\n\n   ```html\n   <head>\n     <link rel=\"preload\" href=\"critical.css\" as=\"style\" />\n     <link rel=\"preload\" href=\"critical.js\" as=\"script\" />\n   </head>\n   ```\n\n9. **Serve images in next-gen formats**: WebP or Avif provide better compression.\n\n","n":0.059}}},{"i":74,"$":{"0":{"v":"Vite","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Blog post\n- [Vite Crash Course Blog](https://www.traversymedia.com/blog/vite-crash-course)\n\n- npx create-vite-app my-app --template react-ts\n- dev server\n- when we build, vite uses `Rollup` (module bundler) to bundle files for production.\n- fast\n- Sass support is built into Vite\n## Start\nnpm init vite@latest vite-project\n\n## Configure port\nWe can also change some settings, including the port that the development server runs on.

Some of them are:\n\n- **include**: Specifies an array of filenames or patterns to include in the program. These filenames are resolved relative to the directory containing the tsconfig.json file. If we have both include and exclude, exclude will filter out the files from include. so compiled files will be include - exclude.\n\n- **exclude**:  Specifies an array of filenames or patterns that should be skipped when resolving include. It is not a mechanism that prevents a file from being included in the codebase - it simply changes what the include setting finds. Can also add regex. eg:\n    ```json\n        \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"] // this is the default behaviour.\n    ```\n\n- **files**: Specifies an allowlist of files to include in the program. An error occurs if any of the files can’t be found.\n\n- **target**: Set the JavaScript language version for emitted JavaScript and include compatible library declarations. eg: \n```json\n{\"target\": \"es6\" }\n```\n\n- **sourceMap**: simplifies debugging. When set this option **true**, it creates .map files which are understood by modern browsers. This allows us to see .ts files in the browser's source tab. Now you can add breakpoints in ts files instead of compiled js in browser.\n\n- **outDir**: folder to store o/p files. Generally ./dist\n- **rootDir**: specify root directory of input files. \n- **removeComments**: when set to true, won't emit comments to output files.\n- **noEmitOnError**: (default: false), when set to true, do not generate output file if input file has compilation error.\n\n## Reference\n- tsconfig Docs: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html\n\n- Compiler Config Docs: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html\n\n- VS Code TS Debugging: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-debugging","n":0.056}}},{"i":82,"$":{"0":{"v":"Classes","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Access modifiers\n- **private**: accessible only within the class.

Now we can get the value of dept by creating reference of Dept.\n\n```ts\n// Note how getters/setters are accessed without ()\n\nconst IT = new Dept('IT');\nconsole.log(IT.DeptId) // getting value\nIT.DeptId = '1234' // setting value\n```\n\n## Static Methods\n\n- Classes may have static members.

They can be accessed through the class constructor object itself:\n- often used for utility functions that you want to group into a class or for global constants.\n- the static methods are decoupled from instances and **cannot** be referenced with `this`.\n- Static members are also inherited.\n\n\neg: `Math.pi`, `Math.pow()`\n\n```ts\nclass Test {\n    static year = 2024;\n    static testFunc() {\n        return \"xyz\";\n    }\n}\n// above func can be used as: \nconst a = Test.testFunc();\nconsole.log(Test.year) //2024\n```\n\n## Abstract Classes\n- A class that can't be instantiated but has to be extended.\n- An abstract class typically includes one or more abstract methods or property declarations. \n- The class which extends the abstract class must define all the abstract methods. \n- We **cannot** create an instance of an abstract class.\n\n## Private Constructors and Singletons\n\nThe singleton pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to make sure that only one instance of a class is created. .\n\n\n```ts\n    class Singleton {\n    private static instance: Singleton;\n    private constructor() {\n        // do something construct...\n    }\n    static getInstance() {\n        if (!Singleton.instance) {\n            Singleton.instance = new Singleton();\n            // ... any one time initialization goes here ...\n        }\n        return Singleton.instance;\n    }\n    someMethod() { }\n}\n\nlet something = new Singleton() // Error: constructor of 'Singleton' is private.\n\nlet instance = Singleton.getInstance() // do something with the instance...\n```\n\n- [Canvas editor singleton example](https://github.com/mindfiredigital/canvas-editor/commit/b09d98dea3a38caba041bab35736bfd2712c068c#diff-ce60497e4a1a947c474a38c5959a2d9499b9531666b1df509ac4305518a93095R11)\n\n","n":0.041}}},{"i":83,"$":{"0":{"v":"Basic Types","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"Typescript's type system helps us during development.\nThe key difference b/w JS and TS type system is JS uses dynamic types(resolves during runtime) and TS uses static types(set during development)\n\n## Core Types\n- **number**: All numbers, no differentiation b/w integers and floats.\n- **string**\n- **boolean**\n- **object**\n- **array**\n- **tuple**: (added by TS) fix length array.\n    eg: In below example, role is tuple. It is a fixed length(2) array with first index value as number and second has string. `person.role[1] = 10; person.role = [1, \"abcd\", \"def\"]` will result in compile time errors. \n    ```js\n    const person:\n    {\n        name: string;\n        role: [number, string] // tuple\n    } = {\n        name: \"John\",\n        role: [2, \"author\"]\n    }\n    ```\n    **Note** : `person.role.push(\"heeloo\")` will not result in a compile time error. This is an exception. TS cannot catch this error.\n\n- **enum**: Automatically enumerated global constant identifiers. \n    ```ts\n    enum Role {ADMIN, READ_ONLY, AUTHOR};\n    ```\n    by default here Role.ADMIN will have value 0, READ_ONLY: 1 and AUTHOR 2. We can change this by\n    ```ts\n    enum Role {\n        ADMIN = \"ADMINISTRATOR\", \n        READ_ONLY =\" Read only users\", \n        AUTHOR = \"Author\"};\n    ```\n\n- **any**\n\n**Note**: The core primitive types in TypeScript are all lowercase!\n\n## Other Types\n- **union**: \n    ```ts \n    let x: number | string;\n    ```\n\n- **literal types**: \n    ```ts\n    let result: 'value1' | 'value2'; // now result cannot be assigned any value other than value1 or value 2. \n    result = \"ok\"; // results in compile time error\n    ```\n\n- **unknown**: we don't know yet what's the type. It is similar to any but more restrictive.\n\n- **never**: never returns anything. eg: error functions\n\n- **symbol**: \nThere is a primitive in JavaScript used to create a globally unique reference via the function Symbol():\n\n```ts\n    const firstName = Symbol(\"name\");\n    const secondName = Symbol(\"name\");\n    \n    if (firstName === secondName) { //This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'typeof firstName' and 'typeof secondName' have no overlap.\n    // Can't ever happen\n    }\n```\n\n## Type Aliases\n\nType aliases can be used to \"create\" your own types. \n\n```ts\ntype NumStringType = number | string;\ntype CustomLiteralType = \"value1\" | \"value2\";\n\n// now these can be used as below:\n\nlet variable1: NumStringType;\n```\n\nYou're not limited to storing union types though - you can also provide an alias to a (possibly complex) object type.\n\nFor example:\n```ts\ntype User = { name: string; age: number };\nconst u1: User = { name: 'Max', age: 30 }; // this works!\n```\nThis allows you to avoid unnecessary repetition and manage types centrally.\n\n## Function return types & void\nreturn type in func is specified after \":\"\n\n```ts\nfunction add(a: number, b: number) : string {\n    const sum = a+b;\n    return `Result is ${sum}`;\n}\n```\n\nThe function that does not have a return statement is of return type void.\n```ts\nfunction add(a: number, b: number) // this is internally :void\n{\n    console.log(a+b); \n}\n\n```\n\nThe function that has a return statement but returns nothing, is of return type undefined\n```ts\nfunction add(a: number, b: number) // this is internally : undefined . You can also use : void here if required. won't throw any error.\n{\n    console.log(a+b); \n    return;\n}\n\n```\n\n## Functions as type\n\n```ts\nlet combinedResult : (a: number, b: number) => number;\n```\n\n## Function Type && Callbacks\n\n```ts\nfunction addAndHandle(n1: number, n2: number, cb: (num: number) => void) {\n  const result = n1 + n2;\n  cb(result);\n}\n\naddAndHandle(10, 20, (result) => {\n  console.log(result);\n});\n```\n**NOTE: ** callback functions can return something, even if the argument on which they're passed does NOT expect a returned value.\n\nfor example: the below code will compile just fine. even though the return type of cb is void and we are returning boolean.\n\n```ts\nfunction sendRequest(data: string, cb: (response: any) => void) {\n  // ... sending a request with \"data\"\n  return cb({data: 'Hi there!'});\n}\n \nsendRequest('Send this!', (response) => { \n  console.log(response);\n  return true;\n });\n```\n\n## Further references\n- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html","n":0.041}}},{"i":84,"$":{"0":{"v":"Advance Types","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"### Intersection types\n- For objects, intersection type is combination of both object properties.\n```ts\ntype TypeA = {};\ntype TypeB = {};\ntype TypeC = TypeA & TypeB // will have props of both TypeA and TypeB\n```\n- for union types, intersection type are the types they have in common.\n\n```ts\ntype Combinable = number | string;\ntype Numeric = boolean | number;\n\ntype Universal = Combinable & Numeric; // intersection would be number\n```\n\n### Typeguards\nWith type guards you avoid runtime errors by checking types before you try to do something with the values.\n\n- instanceOf\n- typeOf\n- property in object\n\nReference: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html\n\n- in case of interfaces, use [discriminated unions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#discriminated-unions).\n\n### index properties\n \n\n - Sometimes you don’t know all the names of a type’s properties ahead of time, but you do know the shape of the values.\n\nIn those cases you can use an index signature to describe the types of possible values, for example:\n```ts\ninterface User {\n    [prop: string]: string\n}\n```\n Read more [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#index-signatures)\n\n ### optional chaining\n\nts supports the below code instead of using `if(user && user.job && user.job.name)`\n ```ts\n if(user?.job?.name)\n ```\n\n ### nullish coalescing\n\n if **null or undefined** used default value;\n eg:\n ```ts\n const username = response.name; // undefined\n const value = username ??

It’s based on the principles of HTTP and uses HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources. REST APIs usually return JSON or XML data.\n- GraphQL is a relatively newer technology. It allows clients to specify the data they need and returns only the requested data in a single response. \n\nHere are some considerations for React developers who need to choose between GraphQL and REST:\n\n- **Data requirements**: If your application requires a lot of different data from different endpoints, GraphQL can be a good option because it allows you to specify exactly what you need. With REST, you might have to make multiple requests to different endpoints to get all the data you need.\n- **Caching**: REST APIs can be more easily cached, which can improve performance. GraphQL has its own caching mechanisms, but they can be more complex to implement.\n- **Learning curve**: GraphQL can have a steeper learning curve for developers who are not familiar with it. REST is a more straightforward technology that many developers are already comfortable with.\n\n\n### virtualization\n- https://blog.logrocket.com/rendering-large-lists-react-virtualized/","n":0.071}}},{"i":87,"$":{"0":{"v":"Saas","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Resource\n- [Traversry Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5mdN2JIwM)","n":0.5}}},{"i":88,"$":{"0":{"v":"Redux","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Redux\n\n- predictable state container for js apps.\n- predictable because in redux, a pattern is enforced to ensure all transitions are explicit and can be tracked.\n\n![](/assets/images/2023-08-22-22-28-35.png)\n\n![](/assets/images/2023-08-22-22-29-07.png)\n\n## Three core concepts\n\n- store\n- action: js object that has a type and payload property.

The component itself does not render anything besides the render prop. Instead, the component simply calls the render prop, instead of implementing its own rendering logic.\n\n- **NOTE**: a render prop doesn’t have to be called render. Any prop that renders JSX is considered a render prop\n\n**props.children is also technically a render prop**\n\n## Example\n\nTo the Component element, we have to pass a prop called render, which is a function that returns a React element.\n\n```jsx\n<Title render={() => <h1>I am a render prop!</h1>} />\nconst Title = (props) => props.render();\n\n```\n\n## Key feature\n\n- **Reusability**: the component that receives the prop is very reusable. We can use it multiple times, passing different values to the render prop each time.\n    ```jsx\n    <Title render={() => <h1>✨ First render prop! ✨</h1>} />\n    <Title render={() => <h2>🔥 Second render prop! 🔥</h2>} />\n    ```\n\n\n##  Why would you want to use this?\n\nA component that takes a render prop usually does a lot more than simply invoking the render prop. Instead, we usually want to pass data from the component that takes the render prop, to the element that we pass as a render prop!\n\n```jsx\nfunction Component(props) {\n  const data = { ... }\n\n  return props.render(data)\n}\n\n//The render prop can now receive this value that we passed as its argument.\n<Component render={(data) => <ChildComponent data={data} />}\n\n```\n\n\n### example\n\nInput value in °F and °K \n\n```jsx\nfunction Input(props) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(\"\");\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        value={value}\n        onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}\n        placeholder=\"Temp in °C\"\n      />\n      {props.render(value)}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <h1>☃️ Temperature Converter 🌞</h1>\n      <Input\n        render={(value) => (\n          <>\n            <Kelvin value={value} />\n            <Fahrenheit value={value} />\n          </>\n        )}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Kelvin({ value = 0 }) {\n  return <div className=\"temp\">{value + 273.15}K</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Fahrenheit({ value = 0 }) {\n  return <div className=\"temp\">{(value * 9) / 5 + 32}°F</div>;\n}\n```\n\n\n### additing addiional props to an exising element (replacing clone elemenet)\n\n[[Cloning | learning.react.legacy.clone-element]]\n children makes it hard to tell how the data flows through your app. Hence we use other alternaives like render prop pattern.\n\n Instead of using cloneElement, consider accepting a render prop like renderItem. Here, List receives renderItem as a prop. List calls renderItem for every item and passes isHighlighted as an argument:\n\n```jsx\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n        return renderItem(item, isHighlighted);\n      })}\n  )\n ```\n\n The renderItem prop is called a “render prop” because it’s a prop that specifies how to render something. For example, you can pass a renderItem implementation that renders a <Row> with the given isHighlighted value:\n \n```jsx\n<List\n  items={products}\n  renderItem={(product, isHighlighted) =>\n    <Row\n      key={product.id}\n      title={product.title}\n      isHighlighted={isHighlighted}\n    />\n  }\n/>\n```\n\n\n## Cons\n\n- The issues that we tried to solve with render props, have largely been replaced by React Hooks. As Hooks changed the way we can add reusability and data sharing to components, they can replace the render props pattern in many cases.\n\n- Since we can’t add lifecycle methods to a render prop, we can only use it on components that don’t need to alter the data they receive.\n\n### example of custom hooks\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\n// Render Prop Component implemented with a functional component\nconst DataFetcher = ({ url, children }) => {\n  const [state, setState] = useState({\n    loading: true,\n    error: null,\n    data: null,\n  });\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    let isMounted = true;\n\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      try {\n        const response = await fetch(url);\n        const data = await response.json();\n        if (isMounted) setState({ loading: false, data });\n      } catch (error) {\n        if (isMounted) setState({ loading: false, error });\n      }\n    };\n\n    fetchData();\n\n    return () => {\n      isMounted = false;

Try to look for Separation of concern(moving state up/creating a separate stateful component) in components before actually utilizing React.memo or usecallback/memo hooks. They are perfectly valid solutions but sometimes unnecessary. For example:\n\n```jsx\nexport default function App() {\n      const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n        <Button onClick={() => setVisible(true)}>Show dialog</Button>\n        {visible && <ModalDialog onClose={() => setVisible(false)} />}      \n        <SlowComponent />\n        <BlaBla />\n        <AdditionalComplexThings />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\nThis can be solved by separation of concern. Just by moving state in a separate stateful component\n```jsx\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <ToggleButtonWithDialog />\n      <SlowComponent />\n      <BlaBla />\n      <AdditionalComplexThings />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Drawbacks of custom hooks\n\n- Custom hooks are typically not the answer to addressing re-rendering issues. While they can help organize and tidy up code, they do not prevent re-rendering when the state is updated. In fact, if a custom hook includes additional states used by multiple components, updating a single state will cause all components using that custom hook to re-render.\n\n\n### Passing components as props.\nThe components which are passed as props to component A and are rendered in it won't re-render if the A re-renders. \nBelow is an example of passing nodes as props. \n\n```jsx\nconst DynamicScroll = ({ content }: { content: ReactNode }) => {\n  const [position, setPosition] = useState(170);\n  const handleScroll = (e: React.UIEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {\n    const newPosition = calculatePosition(e.currentTarget.scrollTop);\n    setPosition(Math.max(113, newPosition));\n  };\n\n  const blockColor = calculateColor(position);\n\n  return (\n    <ScrollableContainer onScroll={handleScroll}>\n      <DynamicBlock top={position === 113 ? 113 : position} color={blockColor}>\n        🛒\n      </DynamicBlock>\n      {content}\n    </ScrollableContainer>\n  );\n};\n\n...\n//App component\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <DynamicScroll\n      content={\n        <>\n          <SlowComponent />\n          <BlaBla />\n          <AdditionalComplexThings />\n        </>\n      }\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nHere, update in state of Dynamic scroll will not re-render the 3 components passed as prop to `DynamicScroll`.\n\n- You can also use the children prop. It will also have the same effect.\n\n```jsx\nconst DynamicScroll = ({ children }) => {\n ...\n\n  return (\n    <ScrollableContainer onScroll={handleScroll}>\n      <DynamicBlock top={position === 113 ? 113 : position} color={blockColor}>\n        🛒\n      </DynamicBlock>\n      {content}\n    </ScrollableContainer>\n  );\n};\n\n...\n//App component\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <DynamicScroll>\n          <SlowComponent />\n          <BlaBla />\n          <AdditionalComplexThings />\n    </DynamicScroll>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n\n- Below is the explanation of why React treats children nodes differently and why they are not re-rendered on state update.\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2025-01-17-18-46-03.png)\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2025-01-17-18-45-16.png)","n":0.05}}},{"i":110,"$":{"0":{"v":"Mui","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Resource\n\n- [Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHEPVdfBAqE&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwh-K9mDlrrcDywl7CeVL2rO&index=1)\n","n":0.577}}},{"i":111,"$":{"0":{"v":"Interview Quiz","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"> source: Akshay Saini\n\n0.

A pure function:\n\n- Minds its own business. It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.\n- Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.\n\n## React State vs Props\n\n- State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.\n- props are inputs to a component, They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.\n\nBoth props and state are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.\n\n## controlled and uncontrolled components\n\nIn Controlled components the form data is handled by react(eg: state) and with uncontrolled comp. form data is handled by DOM itself.\n\n### Controlled Components\n\nIn React, controlled and uncontrolled components are two different approaches to managing the state of a form component.\n\nA controlled component is a component that takes its current value through props and notifies changes through callbacks, like onChange. When a user enters data into a form element, the component's state is updated and the UI is re-rendered with the new values. In other words, the state of the component is controlled by React.\n\nHere's an example of a controlled component for an input field:\n\n```js\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction InputField() {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(\"\");\n\n  function handleChange(event) {\n    setValue(event.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return <input type=\"text\" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the value of the input field is controlled by the value state variable. The handleChange function updates the value state when the input field changes, and the new value is passed down to the input element as a prop.\n\n### Uncontrolled component\n\nan uncontrolled component is a component that manages its own state internally. In an uncontrolled component, the form data is handled by the DOM itself, instead of being managed by React.\n\nHere's an example of an uncontrolled component for an input field:\n\n```js\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nfunction InputField() {\n  function handleSubmit(event) {\n    console.log(\"Input value:\", event.target.elements.inputField.value);\n    event.preventDefault();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"inputField\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the form data is handled by the DOM. When the user submits the form, the handleSubmit function accesses the value of the input field directly from the DOM using event.target.elements.inputField.value.\n\n## Lifecycle phases\n\n- Mounting\n- updating\n- unmounting\n\n### Detail\n\n- **Mounting**: The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from\n  `constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount()` lifecycle methods.\n\n- **Updating**: In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, **sending the new props** and **updating the state** either from setState() or forceUpdate(). This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.\n\n- **Unmounting**: In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.\n\n![Lifecycle of component](/assets/images/2023-04-14-19-35-20.png)\n\n## Context\n\nContext provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.\n\nFor example, authenticated users, locale preferences, UI themes need to be accessed in the application by many components.\n\n```js\nconst { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(defaultValue);\n```\n\n- To pass context:\n  - Create and export it with export const MyContext = createContext(defaultValue).\n  - Pass it to the useContext(MyContext) Hook to read it in any child component, no matter how deep.\n  - Wrap children into <MyContext.Provider value={...}> to provide it from a parent.\n\n## flushSync\nCall flushSync to force React to flush any pending work and update the DOM synchronously.\n```js\nimport { flushSync } from 'react-dom';\n\nflushSync(() => {\n  setSomething(123);\n});\n```\nExample\n\n```js\nfunction App() {\n  const [state, setState] = useState(0)\n  const onClick = () => {\n    console.log('handler')\n    flushSync(() => {\n      setState(state => state + 1)\n    })\n    console.log('handler ' + state)\n  }\n  console.log('render ' + state)\n  return <div>\n    <button onClick={onClick}>click me</button>\n  </div>\n}\n\nuserEvent.click(screen.getByText('click me'))\n\n/**\n * Output\n * \"render 0\"\n * \"handler\"\n * \"render 1\"\n * \"handler 0\"\n * **/\n```\n## TODO\n\n- React.StrictMode #learn\n","n":0.036}}},{"i":115,"$":{"0":{"v":"Virtual Dom","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n**Virtual DOM:**\nThe Virtual DOM is a concept within React that serves as a lightweight representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model). It's a JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the real DOM, containing elements, attributes, and content. The key difference is that the Virtual DOM is not directly tied to the browser's rendering engine, which makes it faster to manipulate and compare.\n\n**Reconciliation Process:**\nWhen a React component's state or props change, React performs a process called reconciliation to determine the minimum number of changes needed to update the actual DOM. Here's an overview of the steps involved in the reconciliation process:\n\n1. **Render Components**: Whenever state or props change, React re-renders the affected components and creates a new Virtual DOM tree.\n\n2. **Diffing**: React then performs a diffing process by comparing the previous Virtual DOM tree with the new one. It identifies the differences between the two trees.\n\n3. **Update Strategy**: React calculates the most efficient way to update the real DOM based on the differences identified during the diffing process. It creates a list of changes (referred to as \"patches\" or \"diffs\") that need to be applied to the actual DOM.\n\n4. **Apply Changes**: Finally, React applies the calculated changes to the real DOM. This involves adding, updating, or removing specific elements as necessary.\n\n**Role of Immutability:**\nImmutability is essential in the reconciliation process because it helps React to accurately and efficiently identify changes in the Virtual DOM. When data is immutable, React can confidently compare data by checking if their references have changed. Here's how immutability contributes to this process:\n\n1. **Change Detection**: React can quickly detect changes by comparing references. If an object or array reference remains the same, React knows that the data hasn't changed. This is much faster than comparing every individual property or element.\n\n2. **Pure Rendering**: React promotes the concept of \"pure\" components that only re-render when their props or state change. Immutability enables pure rendering because components can rely on the immutability of their data to determine if they need to update.\n\n**Example:**\nLet's consider a simple example of a list of items displayed in a React component. We'll use immutability to update the list.\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction ItemList() {\n  const [items, setItems] = useState(['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']);\n\n  const addItem = () => {\n    // Using immutability to update the list\n    const newItem = `Item ${items.length + 1}`;\n    setItems([...items, newItem]); // Creating a new array\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={addItem}>Add Item</button>\n      <ul>\n        {items.map((item, index) => (\n          <li key={index}>{item}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, when we add a new item, we're creating a new array using the spread operator. This maintains immutability, allowing React to efficiently detect the change and update the Virtual DOM accordingly.\n\nBy following the principles of immutability, React can optimize the reconciliation process, resulting in improved performance and a more responsive user interface.","n":0.046}}},{"i":116,"$":{"0":{"v":"Function First Class Entity","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n\nIn programming, when we say something is a \"first-class entity\" or \"first-class citizen,\" we mean that it can be treated as a regular value and can be used in the same ways that other fundamental types (like numbers, strings, etc.) can be used. This concept is crucial to understanding functional programming and the flexibility it offers.\n\n### Characteristics of First-Class Entities\n\n1. **Assignability**: A first-class entity can be assigned to a variable.\n\n2. **Passability**: A first-class entity can be passed as an argument to a function.\n\n3. **Returnability**: A first-class entity can be returned from a function.\n\n4. **Storable**: A first-class entity can be stored in data structures (like arrays, objects, etc.).\n\n### Functions as First-Class Citizens\n\nWhen functions are first-class entities, it means you can do the following:\n\n- **Assign Functions to Variables**: You can have a function assigned to a variable, allowing you to reference and invoke it using that variable.\n  \n  ```javascript\n  const sayHello = function() {\n    console.log(\"Hello!\");\n  };\n  ```\n\n- **Pass Functions as Arguments**: You can pass functions as parameters to other functions, enabling the use of callbacks or events.\n\n  ```javascript\n  function greet(callback) {\n    callback();\n  }\n\n  greet(sayHello); // \"Hello!\" is logged to the console\n  ```\n\n- **Return Functions from Other Functions**: Functions can be returned from other functions, facilitating currying or the creation of function factories.\n\n  ```javascript\n  function createGreeter(name) {\n    return function() {\n      console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n    };\n  }\n\n  const greetJohn = createGreeter(\"John\");\n  greetJohn(); // \"Hello, John!\" is logged\n  ```\n\n- **Store Functions**: Functions can be stored within array elements or object properties.\n\n  ```javascript\n  const actions = {\n    greet: sayHello,\n  };\n\n  actions.greet(); // \"Hello!\" is logged\n  ```\n\n### Importance in JavaScript and React\n\n- **JavaScript**: JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens, which allows for functional programming approaches, including the use of lambdas, closures, and higher-order functions.\n\n- **React**: In React, functional components, hooks, and higher-order components leverage the idea of functions as first-class entities, making the library modular, reusable, and reflective of functional programming paradigms.\n\nBy treating functions as first-class entities, you gain a lot of flexibility and expressive power in your programming toolkit, enabling more abstract, clean, and reusable code structures.","n":0.054}}},{"i":117,"$":{"0":{"v":"Errorhandling","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\n```js\n\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nfunction renderWithError() {\n  throw new Error('error');\n}\n\nfunction A() {\n  return <ErrorBoundary name=\"boundary-2\">{renderWithError()}</ErrorBoundary>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary name=\"boundary-1\">\n      <A />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  )\n}\n\n\nclass ErrorBoundary extends Component<\n  { name: string; children: React.ReactNode },\n  { hasError: boolean }\n> {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\n  }\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromError() {\n    return { hasError: true };\n  }\n\n  componentDidCatch() {\n    console.log(this.props.name);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;\n    }\n\n    return this.props.children;\n  }\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.getElementById('root'))\n\n\n// Output: \"boundary-1\"\n// <ErrorBoundary/>  captures the error from children only and not even from itself.

This means any variable is not strictly bind to a data type.\n\n## Execution context\n\nExecution context is simply the environment within which your code is ran.\nIt has 2 components\n\n- Memory Component(Variable environment): variable and funcs are stored in key: value pairs.\n- Code Component(Thread of execution): place where code is executed one line at a time.\n\n### Two stages of Execution context\n\n- **creation**(memory creation) and\n- **executing**(code execution) phase.\n\n### Two types of execution context\n\n- Global and Function\n\nAs the JavaScript engine starts to read your code, it creates something called the Global Execution Context.\n\n## Lexical environment\n\n- A lexical environment is basically the scope or environment the engine is currently\n  reading code in.\n- A new lexical environment is created when curly brackets {} are used,\n  even nested brackets {{...}} create a new lexical environment.\n- The execution context tells the engine which lexical environment it is currently working in and the lexical scope determines the available variables.\n- lexical env of a func: local memory of function + refrence to lexical parents's lexical env(closure) + lexical env of parent's parent until global scope.\n\n## Scope chain\n\nEach environment context that is created has a link outside of its lexical environment\ncalled the scope chain. The scope chain gives us access to variables in the parent\nenvironment.\n\n## FOR in vs FOR of\n\n```js\nlet list = [4, 5, 6];\n\nfor (let i in list) {\n  console.log(i); // \"0\", \"1\", \"2\",\n}\n\nfor (let i of list) {\n  console.log(i); // \"4\", \"5\", \"6\"\n}\n```\n\n## Block\n\n- defined by `{}`. It groups together multiple js statements and use it where js syntax is expecting single statement\n- let/const are `block scoped`.\n- a new `{}` does not create a new scope for `var`, var is a `function` scope\n\n## let and const\n\n- are hoiseted, but are in `temporal dead zone`(the time between a let/const is hoisted and initialized with a value) for the time being.\n- accessing a variable in temporal dead zone throws reference error\n- cannot redeclare let and const within the same scope unlike `var`. let will throw syntax error and const will throw Type error, since const is of `constant` type.\n- `const` needs to be declare and initialization at the same time, unlike `let` which can be initialized later in the code.\n- unlinke `var` let/const are block scoped. Each `{}` creates a new scope for let/const\n\n## closure\n\nfunction along with its lexical scope bundled together forms a closure.\nUses: currying\n\n## Hoisting\n\n- Hoisting is the process of puting all variable and function declarations into memory\n  during the compile phase.\n- var are hoisted(allocated memory) and initialized with a value of `undefined`\n- function declarations are fully hoisted eg: function a() {}\n- function expression are hoisted as undefined. (eg: var a = function () {})\n- let and const are hoisted but are not initialized with any initial value. Using them before initialization throws reference error\n\n### Takeaways\n\nAvoid hoisting when possible. It can cause memory leaks and hard to catch\nbugs in your code. Use let and const as your go to variables.\n\n## Difference between arrow function and normal function\n\n- arrow funcs are not just a syntactic sugar to normal functions\n- They are a compact alternative to a regular function, but also without its own bindings to `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target` keywords.\n- Arrow func cannot be used as constructors and are not the best option for methods.\n\n````js\nvar obj = {\n  // does not create a new scope\n  i: 10,\n  b: () => console.log(this.i, this),\n  c: function () {\n    console.log(this.i, this);\n  },\n};\nobj.b(); // prints undefined, Window {...} (or the global object)\nobj.c(); // prints 10, Object {...}```\n````\n\n## Call, bind, apply\n\n### Call\n\n- invoke a function with passed references and arguments.\n- used function borrowing\n- 1st param of call is a reference, i.e what should call bind this to? rest are the arguments to the function\n\n### bind\n\nreturns you a copy of method which can be called later.\n\n- function borrowing\n- When a function is used as a callback, `this` is lost. The bind() method solves this problem.\n  eg: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_bind.asp\n\npolyfill for bind:\n\n```js\nconst uname2 = {\n  fname: 'Jo',\n  lname: 'Joshi',\n};\nfunction fullName(city, state) {\n  console.log(this.fname + ' ' + this.lname + ' ' + city + ' ' + state);\n}\nFunction.prototype.myBind2 = function (...args) {\n  const fun = this;\n  const param = args.slice(1);\n  return function (...arg) {\n    fun.apply(args[0], [...param, ...arg]);\n  };\n};\n\nconst test = fullName.myBind2(uname2, 'hld');\ntest('UK');\n```\n\n## Currying\n\n- by bind method\n\n```js\nlet multiply = function (x, y) {\n  console.log(x * y);\n};\n\nconst multiplyBy2 = multiply.bind(this, 2);\nmultiplyBy2(9);\n```\n\n- by closures\n\n```js\nfunction multiply(x) {\n  return function (y) {\n    return x * y;\n  };\n}\nconst multiplyBy2 = multiply(2);\nconsole.log(multiplyBy2(4));\n```\n\n### imp interview ques\n\nhttps://javascriptinterviewquestions.com/2020/04/add123-in-javascript-currying-interview.html\n\n## Debounce\n\n- limiting the rate of execution of a particular function\n\n## this\n\nFree function invocations in javascript have `this` bound to the global scope.\n\n## Event Propagation\n\n- [Bubbling and capturing](https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing)\n\nhappens in 3 phases\n\n- Capturing phase: event goes down from root element to the target element\n- target phase: event reaches the target elem\n- bubbling phase: the event bubbles up from the element.\n\n```html\n<style>\n  body * {\n    margin: 10px;\n    border: 1px solid blue;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<form>\n  FORM\n  <div>\n    DIV\n    <p>P</p>\n  </div>\n</form>\n\n<script>\n  for (let elem of document.querySelectorAll('*')) {\n    elem.addEventListener(\n      'click',\n      (e) => alert(`Capturing: ${elem.tagName}`),\n      true\n    );\n    elem.addEventListener('click', (e) => alert(`Bubbling: ${elem.tagName}`));\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nIn bubbling, When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.\n\n- To stop bubbling: event.stopPropagation()\n\n```html\n<body onclick=\"alert(`the bubbling doesn't reach here`)\">\n  <button onclick=\"event.stopPropagation()\">Click me</button>\n</body>\n```\n\nNOTE: Almost all events bubble.\nThe key word in this phrase is “almost”.\n\nFor instance, a focus event does not bubble. There are other examples too, we’ll meet them. But still it’s an exception, rather than a rule, most events do bubble\n\n## Scripts: async, defer\n\n### Problem\n\nWhen the browser loads HTML and comes across a \"script\" tag, it can’t continue building the DOM. It must execute the script right now. The same happens for external scripts \"script src='...': the browser must wait for the script to download, execute the downloaded script, and only then can it process the rest of the page.\n\nThat leads to two important issues:\n\n- Scripts can’t see DOM elements below them, so they can’t add handlers etc.\n- If there’s a bulky script at the top of the page, it “blocks the page”. Users can’t see the page content till it downloads and runs:\n\n```html\n<p>...content before script...</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1\"></script>\n\n<!-- This isn't visible until the script loads -->\n<p>...content after script...</p>\n```\n\n![](/assets/images/2023-04-11-11-43-22.png)\n\n### Defer\n\n- The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM. The script loads “in the background”, which makes it non-blocking and then runs when the DOM is fully built.\n- Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event). .DOMContentLoaded event handler waits for the deferred script.

If this parameter is skipped, it's assumed to be the first value of the array.\n- if we are not returning anything from the callback functions here, the function returns undefined implicitly.\n- if the initial value is not supplied it defaults to the first item of the array\n\n```js\n[1, 2, 3].reduce((a, b) => {\n  console.log(a, b);\n});\n// 1, 2\n// undefined, 3\n\n[1, 2, 3].reduce((a, b) => {\n  console.log(a, b);\n}, 0);\n// 0,1\n// undefined, 2\n// undefined, 3\n```\n\n#### Edge cases\n```js\nconst getMax = (a, b) => Math.max(a, b);\n\n// callback is invoked for each element in the array starting at index 0\n[1, 100].reduce(getMax, 50); // 100\n[50].reduce(getMax, 10); // 50\n\n// callback is invoked once for element at index 1\n[1, 100].reduce(getMax); // 100\n\n// callback is not invoked\n[50].reduce(getMax); // 50\n[].reduce(getMax, 1); // 1\n\n[].reduce(getMax); // TypeError\n```\n\n```JS\nconst arr = [{\n\tfirstname: \"john\", lastName: \"Doe\", age: 12\n},\n{\n\tfirstname: \"Martha\", lastName: \"Stewart\", age: 22\n},\n{\n\tfirstname: \"Scar\", lastName: \"Jo\", age: 82\n}]\n\nconst data = arr.reduce((acc, curr) => {\nif(curr.age<30) acc.push(curr.firstname);\nreturn acc;\n},[])\n```\n\n### polyfill for map\n\n[[Map pollyfill | learning.javascript.handson.pollyfill#array.map]]\n\n## Promise\n\n- a JS Object which may produce a value in future either a resolved value or a reason it is not reselved\n- can be in one of the three states\n  - pending\n  - fullfilled or\n  - rejected\n\n```js\nconst promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    resolve('done');\n  }, 3000);\n});\n\nasync function x(val) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      if (val % 2 === 0) {\n        resolve('even');\n      } else {\n        reject('odd');\n      }\n    }, 1000);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Promise.prototype.then\n\nFor Promise.prototype.then():\n\n- if function is passed as callback, the return value of the function is used as the fulfillment value\n- for non-function values, previous fulfillment value is used.\n\n![[Promises Exercise|learning.javascript.promises-exercise]]\n\n### Promise.all\n\n- The Promise.all() method takes an iterable of promises as an input, and returns a single Promise that resolves to an array of the results of the input promises.\n- fail-fast behavior\n\n## Callback hell\n\n- Callback hell is a antipattern when there are nested callbacks leading to unlegibale code.\n  Can be fixed by:\n- async awaits\n- writing promises\n\n## Ariety\n\nsum(1)(2)....(5) = //\n\n```js\nfunction add(...args) {\n  let a = args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\n  return function (...args) {\n    let b = args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\n    if (b) {\n      return add(a + b);\n    }\n    return a;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Polyfill for Promise.all\n[[Promise.all pollyfill | learning.javascript.handson.pollyfill#promise.all]]\n\n## Prototypical Ineritence\n\n-\n\n","n":0.025}}},{"i":135,"$":{"0":{"v":"Type Coercion","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Type coersion for primitive type\n\n## To number\n\nHere is how primitive values are converted to numbers:\n\n```\nNumber(null)                   // 0\nNumber(undefined)              // NaN\nNumber(true)                   // 1\nNumber(false)                  // 0\nNumber(\" 12 \")                 // 12\nNumber(\"-12.34\")               // -12.34\nNumber(\"\\n\")                   // 0\nNumber(\" 12s \")                // NaN\nNumber(123)                    // 123\nNumber({})                      //NaN\n```\n\n- null and undefined are handled differently: null becomes 0, whereas undefined becomes NaN.\n\n### Triggered via\n\n- comparison operators (>, <, <=,>=)\n- bitwise operators ( | & ^ ~)\n- arithmetic operators (- + \\* / % ). Note, that binary + does not trigger numeric conversion, when any operand is a string.\n- unary + operator\n- loose equality operator == (incl. !=).\n- Note that == does not trigger numeric conversion when both operands are strings.\n\nThere are two special rules to remember:\n\n1. When applying == to null or undefined, numeric conversion does not happen. null equals only to null or undefined, and does not equal to anything else.\n\n```\nnull == 0               // false, null is not converted to 0\nnull == null            // true\nundefined == undefined  // true\nnull == undefined       // true\n```\n\n3. NaN does not equal to anything even itself:\n\n```\nif (value !== value) { console.log(\"we're dealing with NaN here\") }\n```\n\n## To string\n\nImplicit coercion is triggered by the binary + operator, when any operand is a string:\n\n```\nString({})   // '[object Object]'\n```\n\n## To Boolean\n\n```\nBoolean('')           // false\nBoolean(0)            // false\nBoolean(-0)           // false\nBoolean(NaN)          // false\nBoolean(null)         // false\nBoolean(undefined)    // false\nBoolean(false)        // false\n```\n\n- Any value that is not in the list is converted to true, including object, function, Array, Date, user-defined type, and so on.\n  eg :\n\n```\nBoolean({})             // true\nBoolean([])             // true\nBoolean(Symbol())       // true\n!!Symbol()              // true\nBoolean(function() {})  // true\n```\n\n### Triggered via\n\nImplicit conversion happens in logical context, or is triggered by logical operators ( || && !) .\n\n# Type coercion for objects\n\n- When it comes to objects and engine encounters expression like [1] + [2,3], first it needs to convert an object to a primitive value, which is then converted to the final type. And still there are only three types of conversion: numeric, string and boolean.\n\nBoth numeric and string conversion make use of two methods of the input object: valueOf and toString . Both methods are declared on Object.prototype and thus available for any derived types, such as Date, Array, etc\n\nNumeric conversion first calls valueOf with a fallback to toString.\nString conversion does the opposite: toString followed by valueOf\n\nIn general the algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. If input is already a primitive, do nothing and return it.\n\n2. Call input.toString(), if the result is primitive, return it.\n\n3. Call input.valueOf(), if the result is primitive, return it.\n\n4. If neither input.toString() nor input.valueOf() yields primitive, throw TypeError.\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nconsole.log(1 + 2);\nconsole.log(1 + +2);\nconsole.log(1 + +(+2));\nconsole.log(1 + \"2\");\nconsole.log(1 + +\"2\");\nconsole.log(\"1\" + 2);\nconsole.log(\"1\" + +2);\nconsole.log(1 + true);\nconsole.log(1 + +true);\nconsole.log(\"1\" + true);\nconsole.log(\"1\" + +true);\nconsole.log(1 + null);\nconsole.log(1 + +null);\nconsole.log(\"1\" + null);\nconsole.log(\"1\" + +null);\nconsole.log(1 + undefined);\nconsole.log(1 + +undefined);\nconsole.log(\"1\" + undefined);\nconsole.log(\"1\" + +undefined);\nconsole.log(\"1\" + +(+undefined));\n```\n\nAns:\n3\n3\n3\n'12'\n3\n'12'\n'12'\n2\n2\n'1true'\n'11'\n1\n1\n'1null'\n'10'\nNaN\nNaN\n'1undefined'\n'1NaN'\n'1NaN'\n","n":0.047}}},{"i":136,"$":{"0":{"v":"Security","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- [OWASP Top Ten Vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)\n\n## OWASP(Open Web Application Security Project )\n\nThe OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top Ten is a widely recognized list of the most critical web application security risks. These vulnerabilities represent common issues that can lead to security breaches if not properly addressed.\n\n### **Injection**:\n\nThis occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, leading to unintended actions. An attacker can manipulate input fields to execute arbitrary code.\n\n#### Example\n\n- **SQL Injection** - Attacker inserts malicious SQL code into a login form, gaining unauthorized access to a database.\n\n  - SQL Injection Based on **1=1** is Always True.\n\n  ```sql\n  SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;\n  ```\n\n  - SQL Injection Based on Batched SQL Statements\n\n  ```js\n  txtUserId = getRequestString('UserId');\n  txtSQL = 'SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = ' + txtUserId;\n  //What is user entered 105; DROP TABLE Suppliers in input box for UserId? The txtSQL will result in:\n  SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105; DROP TABLE Suppliers;\n  ```\n\n  #### Prevention\n\n  - using **PREPARED STATEMENTS**: The idea is very simple - the query and the data are sent to the database server separately.\n\nThe _mysql2_ library handles the parameter binding and escaping internally, ensuring that each value is treated as **data**, not **executable code**.\n\n```js\napp.post('/batchInsert', (req, res) => {\n  const usersToInsert = req.body.users; // An array of user objects\n\n  // Using a prepared statement for batch insert\n  const sql = 'INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (?, ?)';\n  const values = usersToInsert.map(user => [user.username, user.email]);\n\n  connection.query(sql, [values], (err, results) => {\n    if (err) {\n      ...\n    }\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n### Identification and Authentication Failures (previously, Broken Authentication)\n\nFlaws in authentication and session management can lead to unauthorized access to accounts and sensitive data.\n\n#### example\n\n- **Credential stuffing** - Attackers use previously stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on various sites.\n\n#### Prevention\n\n- Implement strong password policies, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), use secure session management, and enforce secure password storage (e.g., bcrypt hashing).\n\n### Cryptographic Failures (previously : Sensitive Data Exposure)\n\nThis vulnerability involves inadequate protection of sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information.\n\n#### Example:\n\n- **Insecure storage** - Storing passwords in plain text instead of hashing them, making it easy for attackers to steal user credentials.\n\n#### Prevention\n\n- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and during transmission (use HTTPS).\n- Avoid storing sensitive information unless absolutely necessary.\n- Implement proper access controls to limit who can access sensitive data.\n- Disable caching for response that contain sensitive data.\n\n### Insecure Design\n\n_Scenario_: A chain of cinemas provides discounts for group bookings but mandates a deposit when the group size exceeds fifteen attendees. Malicious actors could analyze this process and attempt to determine whether it's possible to reserve six hundred seats across all cinemas in just a few requests. This could potentially lead to a significant financial loss.\n\n### **Broken Access Control**:\n\nImproper enforcement of restrictions on what authenticated users can do can lead to unauthorized actions.\n\n- Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions\n\n#### Example:\n\n- Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account, by providing its unique identifier (insecure direct object references)\n\n_Scenario_: _An application allows users to view their own account details by navigating to https://example.com/profile?user_id=123. The attacker changes the user_id parameter to access another user's account._\n\n- CORS misconfiguration allows API access from unauthorized/untrusted origins.\n\n#### Prevention\n\n- Except for public resources, deny access by default.\n- Stateful session identifiers should be invalidated on the server after logout. Stateless JWT tokens should rather be short-lived so that the window of opportunity for an attacker is minimized. For longer lived JWTs it's highly recommended to follow the OAuth standards to revoke access.\n\n### **Security Misconfiguration**:\n\nFailure to securely configure settings and security controls can expose sensitive data or provide attackers with unnecessary access.\n\n#### Example:\n\n- _Default credentials_ - Leaving default usernames and passwords for admin accounts, enabling attackers to easily access and control the application.\n\n_Scenario_: An application's admin panel has default credentials (admin/admin). The attacker uses these credentials to log in and compromise the system.\n\nIn 2023 guidelines, XXE is also under this.\n\n#### XML External Entity (XXE)\n\nXXE security vulnerability allows a attacker to inject unsafe XML entities into a web application that processes XML data. Attackers can exploit this to read files on the server.\neg:\n\n- Attacker submits malicious XML input that references a sensitive file, gaining unauthorized access to its content.\n\n### **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:\n\nXSS occurs when an application includes untrusted data in a web page, allowing attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser.\n\n#### Example:\n\nin an input feild, that directly gets added to the DOM, attacker might add a script to execute something like:\n\n```html\n<button\n  onclick=\"window.location.href = \n'http://malicious-site.com'\"\n>\n  Get offers\n</button>\n```\n\n#### Prevention\n\n- implement non-bypassable Content Security Policy(CSP) policy. CSP specifies which sources of content are considered valid for specific types of resources on a web page\n\n### **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**\n\nSSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL\n\n#### CSRF\n\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.\n\n### Vulnerable and Outdated Components (previously: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities)\n\nIntegrating outdated or vulnerable third-party components can expose applications to known exploits.\n\n#### Example:\n\n- Including a vulnerable version of a library in an application, allowing attackers to exploit known weaknesses.\n\n### Security Logging and Monitoring Failures\n\nWithout proper logging and monitoring, detecting and responding to security incidents becomes challenging.\n\n#### Example:\n\n- Failing to log failed login attempts, making it difficult to identify and respond to a brute-force attack.\n","n":0.032}}},{"i":137,"$":{"0":{"v":"Promises Exercise","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Promise methods are static methods: Promise.all, Promise.race, Promise.any\n- Promis.race is useful when you want the first async task to complete, but do not care about its eventual state (i.e., it can either succeed or fail).\n- Promise.all returns a single promise with either fulfilled values of all Promises or the rejected promise.

Without applying transition, the element would abruptly change sizes. Add the transition to the parent selector (not the hover selector). To make the transition smooth on both hover-over/hover-off._\r\n```css\r\ndiv {\r\n  transition: transform 1s;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv:hover {\r\n  transform: scale(2);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### rotate\r\n\r\n- rotate(90deg): clockwise 90\r\n- rotate(-90deg): anticlockwise 90\r\n- You can rotate more than a full rotation with numbers over than 360, such as 1080deg, for three full rotations.\r\n\r\n```css\r\ndiv {\r\n  transition: transform 1s;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv:hover {\r\n  transform: rotate(1080deg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### translate\r\n- moves an element left/right and up/down.\r\n- +x: right, -x: left\r\n- +y: down, -y: up\r\n\r\n```css\r\ndiv {\r\n  transition: transform 1s;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv:hover {\r\n  transform: translate(20px, 20px);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### skew\r\n- the element skews (or tilts) one direction or the other.\r\n- +x: left, -x: right (oposite of translate)\r\n- +y: down, -y: up\r\n\r\n```css\r\ndiv {\r\n  transition: transform 1s;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv:hover {\r\n  transform: skewX(-20deg);\r\n}\r\n```","n":0.051}}},{"i":157,"$":{"0":{"v":"Responsive Design","n":0.707}}},{"i":158,"$":{"0":{"v":"Grid","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Cheatsheet\n- [Cheatsheet](https://grid.malven.co/)\n- [Grid Garden game](https://cssgridgarden.com/)\n\n## Grid\n\nGrid also introduces a new unit, the fractional fr. Each fr unit allocates one share of the available space. For example, if two elements are set to 1fr and 3fr respectively, the space is divided into 4 equal shares; the first element occupies 1/4 and the second element 3/4 of any leftover space.\n\n```css\n.container {\n    display: grid; \n    /* 1fr stands for 1 fraction. In the below css, column 3 is twice as column 1 & 2. */\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 2fr;\n    gap: 2rem;\n}\n```\n\n- can also use **repeat** for values\n```css\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\n  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr; \n  gap: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n- use **auto** when fraction needs to be adjusted automatically\n```css\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  /* will automatically adjust the 1st column based on content */\n  grid-template-columns: auto 1fr 1fr;\n  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr; \n  gap: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n**Most common pattern**\n```css\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));\n}\n```\nLet's break down the value:\n\n- **repeat(auto-fill, ...)**: This part indicates that you want to repeat the following column definition as many times as possible within the available space. The auto-fill keyword means that the grid will automatically create as many columns as it can fit within the container.\n- **minmax(200px, 1fr)**: This part sets the sizing for each column. It defines a range between a minimum and maximum size for the columns.\n200px is the minimum width that each column should have. Columns will not become narrower than this value.\n1fr represents the flexible part of the column sizing. It tells the grid to distribute any available space evenly among the columns. So, if there's extra space beyond the minimum requirement, it will be distributed equally among the columns.\n\n\nThe combination of auto-fill and minmax(200px, 1fr) allows the grid to automatically adjust the number of columns based on the available space while ensuring that each column is at least 200px wide. If there's additional space available, the columns will expand equally to fill the remaining space.\n\n__NOTE__: **grid-template** is a shorthand property that combines grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns.\n\nbelow eg. will create a grid with two rows that are 50% each, and one column that is 200 pixels wide.\n\n```css\n#garden {\n    grid-template: 50% 50% / 200px;\n } \n```\n\n## Grid Column Properties\n\n- **grid-column-start**\n```css\n.green {\n    /* start the green class item from grid 2 */\n    grid-column-start: 2\n}\n```\n\n- When **grid-column-start** is used alone, the grid item by default will span exactly one column. However, you can extend the item across multiple columns by adding the **grid-column-end** property.\n\n- **grid-column**: \ngrid-column is a shorthand property that can accept both values at once, separated by a slash.\n\nFor example, \n```css\ngrid-column: 2 / 4;\n```\n will set the grid item to start on the 2nd vertical grid line and end on the 4th grid line.\n\n\n```css\n.green {\n    /* span the column across 2 grids for ele with class green */\n    grid-column: span 2\n}\n```\n\n\n- **grid-area**\n\nthere's yet another shorthand for that. grid-area accepts four values separated by slashes: grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, followed by grid-column-end.\n\nOne example of this would be \n```css\n.green {\n    grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 6;\n}\n```\n\n","n":0.045}}},{"i":159,"$":{"0":{"v":"Flex Box","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Flexbox\n\n```css\n  display: flex;\n```\n## Properties\n\n### justify-content\naligns items horizontally.\n\nAccepted values: \n* flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.\n* flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.\n* center: Items align at the center of the container.\n* space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.\n* space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.\n\n### align-items\naligns items vertically.\n\nAccepted values: \n* flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.\n* flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.\n* center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.\n* baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.\n* stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.\n\n### align-content\n set how multiple lines are spaced apart from each other.\n * flex-start: Lines are packed at the top of the container.\n* flex-end: Lines are packed at the bottom of the container.\n* center: Lines are packed at the vertical center of the container.\n* space-between: Lines display with equal spacing between them.\n* space-around: Lines display with equal spacing around them.\n* stretch: Lines are stretched to fit the container.\n\n__This can be confusing, but align-content determines the spacing between lines, while align-items determines how the items as a whole are aligned within the container.

This shorthand property accepts the value of the two properties separated by a space.\n\nFor example, you can use flex-flow: row wrap to set rows and wrap them.\n\n### align-self\nAnother property you can apply to individual items is align-self. This property accepts the same values as align-items and its value for the specific item.\n\n### order\nSometimes reversing the row or column order of a container is not enough. In these cases, we can apply the order property to individual items. By default, items have a value of 0, but we can use this property to also set it to a positive or negative integer value (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2).\n\n\n\n\n## TODO\nAnimation CSS #learn\n```css\n@keyframes App-logo-spin {\n  from {\n    transform: rotate(0deg);\n  }\n  to {\n    transform: rotate(360deg);\n  }\n}\n```\n","n":0.046}}},{"i":160,"$":{"0":{"v":"Selectors","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Simple selectors\n\n- **.class**: class selector\n- **div.class**: The class selector only for specific element(div)\n- **#id** : id selector\n- **h1**: group selector\n- **h1, p**: to group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.\n\n## CSS Combinators\n- descendant selector (space)\n- child selector (>)\n- adjacent sibling selector (+)\n- general sibling selector (~)\n### examples\n\n- **div p**: all elements that are descendants of a specified element.\n- **div > p**: all elements that are the **direct** children of a specified element.\n- **div + p**:  element that is directly after another specific element.

Router Chain\nA Router Chain is a LangChain pattern used when you don’t want one single prompt or chain to handle every input, but instead want the system to decide which chain should run based on the input.\n\nThink of it as an LLM-powered if / else or switch statement.\n**The core idea** : Given an input, choose the most appropriate chain to handle it.\nExample:\nIf input is a math question → use math chain\nIf input is code-related → use coding chain\nIf input is customer support → use support chain\nYou route the request to the right specialist\n\n### Key benefits of using Chain\n\n🔹 **1. Prompt templating & variable injection**\nThis becomes powerful when: Prompts are long, Variables are many, Prompts are reused across files.\n\n**🔹 2. Reusability & maintainability** \nYou define the prompt once, Instead of copy-pasting prompts everywhere.\n```py\nchain.run(\"Queen Size Sheet Set\")\nchain.run(\"Organic Soap\")\nchain.run(\"AI SaaS Platform\")\n```\n**🔹 3. Easy model swapping & configuration**\nChange model/temperature without touching your logic.\n```py\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0.2)\n```\n**🔹 4. Multi-step workflows (SequentialChain)**\nWhile an LLMChain represents a single step, real power comes from composing multiple LLMChains using SequentialChain, RouterChain, or Agents.\n\n**🔹 5. Composition(chains calling chains) with tools, memory, retrievers**\n\nChains can be stacked:\n```py\nUser Input\n   ↓\nSummarization Chain\n   ↓\nTranslation Chain\n   ↓\nTone Adjustment Chain\n   ↓\nFinal Output\n```\n\nChains can integrate: 🔍 Vector databases, 🧠 Conversation memory, 🛠️ Tools & function calling, 🔄 Retries & fallback models, 📊 Tracing & observability\n\nExample:\n\n```py\n\nUser Question\n   ↓\nRetrieve relevant docs\n   ↓\nInsert into prompt\n   ↓\nLLM answers with citations\n```\nThis is the backbone of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).\n\n## Retrieval (RAG)\n\nLangChain makes it easy to:\n- Load documents (PDFs, Notion, websites)\n- Embed them into vectors\n- Store them in a vector database\n- Retrieve relevant chunks\n- Inject them into the prompt\n\nThis pattern is called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.\n\n### Common components of RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation)\n\n```mermaid\n  graph TD;\n      Data-Source-->Data-Transformation;\n      Data-Transformation-->Text-embedding;\n      Text-embedding-->VectorStore-DB;\n```\n\n- **Data-Ingestion**: (Load data into langchain/Data ingestion)\n\n- **Data-Transformation** : (breaking data into text chunks)\n\n- **Embedding**: converting text into vectors using embedding techniques. This is required for different algorithms to run(similarity serach). \n\n- **VectorStore-DB**: saving vectors into a vector DB ex: chromaDB, FAISS, ASTRADB\n\nThe details are present in their

create_retrieval_chain. Why do we need them?\n\nImagine you had just a normal LLM chain:\n```py\nresponse = llm.invoke(\"What is LangChain?\")\n```\nWhat happens? The LLM answers from its training data. It does NOT access your documents. It may hallucinate. It cannot see your vector database.\n\nSo this is just:\n🧠 LLM only\nNo retrieval.\nNo grounding.\n\nWhat if your answer depends on:\n- Private PDFs\n- Company documents\n- Database entries\nThe plain chain cannot access those. That’s why RAG exists.\n\n🔹 **Now Let’s See What Each Chain Adds**\n\nWe split the problem into two responsibilities:\n- 🔎 Get relevant documents\n- 🧠 Use those documents to answer\n\nEach chain handles one responsibility.\n\n###  1️⃣ create_stuff_documents_chain (aka the document combine chain)\nWhat it does: It takes\n- A question\n- A list of documents\n\nAnd:\n\n“Stuffs” all document text into `{context}`\n\nInjects that into your prompt\n\nCalls the LLM\n\nReturns the generated answer\n\n\n```py\n#Conceptually this is what the chain does\n\ndef document_chain(question, docs):\n    context = \"\\n\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)\n    \n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    Answer based only on the context.\n\n    Question:\n    {question}\n\n    Context:\n    {context}\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    return llm.invoke(prompt)\n\n```\nSo this chain replaces your plain LLM chain with:\nLLM + injected document context\n\n### 2️⃣ create_retrieval_chain\n\nIt does:\n\n- Take the question\n- Call retriever\n- Get relevant documents\n- Pass them to document_chain\n- Return final answer\n\nConceptually:\n```py\ndef retrieval_chain(question):\n    docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(question)\n    return document_chain(question, docs)\n```\n\nso it replaces this manual writing to one single call\n```py\nretrieval_chain.invoke({\"input\": question})\n```\n\n## Miscellaneous \nOne of the way to write this in LCEL is (you we really need to write in LCEL)\n\n```py\nchain = (\n    {\n        \"context\": retriever,\n        \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()\n    }\n    | prompt\n    | llm\n)\nchain.invoke(\"What is langchain?\")\n```\n\nEach runnable executes.\nFor input: What is langchain, The first block is this dictionary:\n\n**Step 1**\n```py\n{\n    \"context\": retriever,\n    \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()\n}\n```\nThis block runs both values in parallel with the SAME input.\nSo Internally this happens:\n\n1A:\n```py\nRunnablePassthrough().invoke(\"What is LangChain?\") #output: What is langchain?\n# RunnablePassthrough() → returns the input unchanged\n```\n1B\n```py\nretriever.invoke(\"What is langchain?\")\n#returns [Document(...), Document(...)]\n\n```\n\n**Result of Step 1**\n```py\n{\n    \"context\": [Document(...), Document(...)],\n    \"question\": \"What is langchain?\"\n}\n```\n    \n**Important: In LCEL Retriever Is a Runnable**\nIn LCEL, a retriever is a Runnable. You’re defining a computation graph, not values. That means it behaves like:\n```\ninput → output\n```\nSo inside a runnable mapping:\n```py\nchain = {\n   \"context\": retriever\n} | prompt | llm\n```\n\nMeans:\n```\n\"context\" = retriever.invoke(input)\n```\n\nNOT:\n```py\n\"context\" = retriever\n```\nThis here below means \"context\" = retriever object. That literally passes the retriever object.\n```py\nchain.invoke({\n    \"context\": retriever\n})\n```\n\n**STEP 2 — Prompt Runs**\nThe prompt template expects: {question} and {context} so in LCEL chain above  `| prompt`\nis internally \n```py\nprompt.invoke({\n    \"question\": \"What is LangChain?\",\n    \"context\": [Document(...)]\n})\n```\nResult of Step 2\n```py\n#formatted_prompt\n\"Answer the question: What is LangChain?\nContext:\nLangChain is a framework for...\"\n```\n\n**STEP 3 — LLM Runs**\n\nNow that formatted prompt is passed to: `| llm`\n\n```\nllm.invoke(formatted_prompt)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n\"LangChain is a framework designed to build applications using LLMs...\"\n```","n":0.043}}},{"i":172,"$":{"0":{"v":"vector-store","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## FAISS\n```py\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader\nfrom langchain_community.embeddings import OllamaEmbeddings\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS\nfrom langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter\n\n## loading text\nloader=TextLoader(\"speech.txt\")\ndocuments=loader.load()\n\n## trnsforming into chunks\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000,chunk_overlap=30)\ndocs= text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n\n## creating embeddings\nembeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model=\"mxbai-embed-large\")\n## storing embeddings into DB\ndb = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)\n\n## querying the DB\nquery=\"How does the speaker describe the desired outcome of the war?\"\nans=db.similarity_search(query)\nans[0].page_content\n# consoles somethig like: 'It will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck.'\n\nquery_vector=embeddings.embed_query(query)\ndb.similarity_search_by_vector(query_vector)\n\n\n### Retriever\n# acts as an interface for vector DB.

List[str]\nfinal_docs=text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\nfinal_docs\n```\n\nThis text splitter is the recommended one for generic text. It is parameterized by a list of characters. It tries to split on them in order until the chunks are small enough. The default list is [\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]. This has the effect of trying to keep all paragraphs (and then sentences, and then words) together as long as possible, as those would generically seem to be the strongest semantically related pieces of text.\n\n- How the text is split: by list of characters.\n- How the chunk size is measured: by number of characters.\n\n**What constraints is it trying to satisfy?**\n\nPrimarily:\n-chunk_size – each chunk must be ≤ this size\n-chunk_overlap – overlap between chunks\n- Semantic preservation – avoid splitting in the middle of sentences/words if possible\n\n**How the recursion works**\n\nYou give the splitter an ordered list of separators, for example:\n```py\n[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]\n```\nThe splitter tries them in order:\n1. Try the first separator (e.g. \\n\\n)\n    - Does splitting by this produce chunks ≤ chunk_size?\n\n    - If yes → ✅ it works, stop here.\n\n2. If chunks are still too large → recurse\n\n    - Try the next separator (\\n)\n    \n3.Continue until a separator works\n\n4. If nothing works → fall back to **character-level splitting (\"\")**\n\n## Character Text Splitters (CharacterTextSplitter)\nThis is the simplest method. This splits based on a given character sequence, which defaults to \"\\n\\n\". Chunk length is measured by number of characters.\n\n1. How the text is split: by single character separator.\n2. How the chunk size is measured: by number of characters.\n\n```py\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader\nfrom langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter\n\nloader = TextLoader(\"speech.txt\")\ndocs = loader.load()\n#by default separator=\\n\\n\ntext_splitter=CharacterTextSplitter(separator=\" \", chunk_size=40, chunk_overlap=15)\nfinal_docs=text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\nfinal_docs\n```\n\n## HTMLHeaderTextSplitter\n\nHTMLHeaderTextSplitter is not primarily a chunk-size splitter.\n\nIts job is to:\n\n- Parse HTML\n- Group text by semantic structure `(headers like <h1>, <h2>)`\n- Attach the header hierarchy as metadata\n\n```py\nfrom langchain_text_splitters import HTMLHeaderTextSplitter\nurl = \"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/\"\n\nheaders_to_split_on = [\n    (\"h1\", \"Header 1\"),\n    (\"h2\", \"Header 2\"),\n]\nhtml_splitter = HTMLHeaderTextSplitter(headers_to_split_on)\nhtml_header_splits = html_splitter.split_text_from_url(url)\nhtml_header_splits\n```\n\n\n- Downloads the HTML from the URL\n- Parses the DOM\n- Finds `<h1> / <h2>` tags you specified\n- Collects all text nodes that appear after a header and before the next relevant header\n- Concatenates that text into a single string\n- Stores it as Document.page_content\n\n\n## RecurrsiveJsonSplitter\n\nThis json splitter splits json data while allowing control over chunk sizes. It traverses json data depth first and builds smaller json chunks. It attempts to keep nested json objects whole but will split them if needed to keep chunks between a min_chunk_size and the max_chunk_size.\n\nIf the value is not a nested json, but rather a very large string the string will not be split. If you need a hard cap on the chunk size consider composing this with a Recursive Text splitter on those chunks. There is an optional pre-processing step to split lists, by first converting them to json (dict) and then splitting them as such.\n\n- How the text is split: json value.\n- How the chunk size is measured: by number of characters.\n\n```py\nimport json\nimport requests\nfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveJsonSplitter\n\njson_data=requests.get(\"https://api.smith.langchain.com/openapi.json\").json()\n\njson_text = RecursiveJsonSplitter(max_chunk_size=100)\njson_chunks=json_text.split_json(json_data)\n```","n":0.044}}},{"i":175,"$":{"0":{"v":"Document Ingestion","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"Loading data from a specific source.\n## Document Loaders\n[Official docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders)\n\n- all document loaders are in this package: ***langchain_community.document_loaders***\n\n- requirements: based on the document loader type(pdf, arxiv, text etc) the frequirements would change.\n```txt\nlangchain\nipykernel\nlangchain_community\n```\n\n```py\n## Text loader\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader\nloader = TextLoader('speech.txt')\ntext_document=loader.load()\ntext_document\n\n## Arxiv Loader(research paper)\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import ArxivLoader\nloader = ArxivLoader(\n    query=\"1706.03762\",\n    load_max_docs=2,\n)\ndocs = loader.load()\ndocs[0]\n```","n":0.141}}},{"i":176,"$":{"0":{"v":"LangGraph","n":1},"1":{"v":"- LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.\n- used to design agents that reliably handle complex tasks\n\n## Components\n1.

It checks the data at runtime and throws an error if the types don't match.\n\nThe \"**Double Underscore**\" Constants: You’ll see `__end__` or END. These are built-in markers that tell the graph \"we are done.\"\n\nIn LangGraph, **compile**() validates the graph. It checks if you have any \"dead ends\" (nodes with no edges) or if your conditional logic points to nodes that don't exist. It turns your definition into a Runnable that supports streaming and checkpoints.","n":0.048}}}]}
