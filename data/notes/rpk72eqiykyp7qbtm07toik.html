<ul>
<li>gain validated learning</li>
<li>take initial steps like we perform a science experiment
<ul>
<li>have a hypothesis</li>
<li>make calculated prediction in theory</li>
<li>perform</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>begin small experiments immediately
<ul>
<li>break it down and calculate value and growth hypothesis(value hypothesis is if the new feature/product adds alue to customer? growth hypothesis describes the growth of feature/product after shipping it.)</li>
<li>an experiment is a product. Instead of manager asking engineer to build certain requirements. The lean startup encourages team to answer these questions:
a. Do customer release it is a problem which you aim to solve?
b. If there was a solution, will it increase growth?
c. can we build the solution ?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>success is not delivering feature; success is learning how to solve customer's problem</em></p>
