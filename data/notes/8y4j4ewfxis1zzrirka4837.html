<p>The final book in the Ram Chandra Series is considerably lengthy, providing extensive details on various aspects. Nonetheless, the initial chapters shine with their skillfully crafted conversations among Ravan, Sita, and Kumbhkaran.</p>
<p>As the narrative unfolds, we discover that Sita is, indeed, Vedavati's daughter, a suspicion I had entertained to some extent. Vishwamitra, already aware of this revelation, devises additional strategies that may be explored in potential spin-offs. However, the book would have benefited from trimming at least 100 pages as it suffers from pacing issues, leading to significant lag.</p>

Previously established as a prominent villain throughout the preceding three books, his reduced significance following the mere mention of Vedavati lacks depth and leaves the reader wanting more in terms of character development and consistency. It was difficult to comprehend the abrupt change of heart considering that he already knew Vedavati was deceased.</p>
