## Normalization

- Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy from a relation or set of relations
  There are various level of normalization. These are some of them:

1. First Normal Form (1NF)
2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
5. Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
6. Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

### 1NF

First Normal Form (1NF):
If a relation contains a composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates the first normal form, or the relation is in first normal form if it does not contain any composite or multi-valued attribute. A relation is in first normal form if every attribute in that relation is singled valued attribute.

A table is in 1 NF if:

- There are only Single Valued Attributes.
- Attribute Domain does not change.
- There is a unique name for every Attribute/Column.
- The order in which data is stored does not matter.

## 2NF

- full functional dependency
