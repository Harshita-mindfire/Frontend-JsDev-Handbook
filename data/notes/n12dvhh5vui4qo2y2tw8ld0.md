  In nextjs, how does getStaticPath() returning {fallback: true} differ from getServerSideProps? Isn't both of them generate pages just in time? Why do we need getServerSideProps if fallback true does the exact same thing?

**Answer**

While `{fallback: true}` and `getServerSideProps` both generate pages dynamically at runtime, they have some important differences that make them better suited for different use cases.

Firstly, `{fallback: true}` is typically used for generating pages for dynamic routes that have a large number of possible values, but only a small subset of those values are actually used frequently. In this case, it's not practical to pre-render all possible values at build-time because it would take too long or consume too much resources. Instead, using `{fallback: true}` allows you to pre-render only the most frequently used values at build-time, and generate the remaining pages on-demand at runtime. This can lead to faster build times and reduced resource usage.

On the other hand, `getServerSideProps` is useful when you need to generate pages that require data that can't be pre-fetched at build-time. For example, if you have a page that shows real-time data or user-specific data, you can use `getServerSideProps` to fetch the necessary data at runtime and generate the page on the server-side. This ensures that the page always shows the most up-to-date information.

Additionally, `getServerSideProps` gives you more control over the page generation process. With `{fallback: true}`, you have less control over the timing and order of page generation, and you can't do things like server-side rendering conditional content. With `getServerSideProps`, you have full control over the data fetching and rendering process, and can generate pages with more complex logic.

In summary, while `{fallback: true}` and `getServerSideProps` can both generate pages dynamically at runtime, they are better suited for different use cases. `{fallback: true}` is useful for generating pages for dynamic routes with a large number of possible values, while `getServerSideProps` is useful for generating pages that require real-time or user-specific data, or that have more complex rendering logic.
