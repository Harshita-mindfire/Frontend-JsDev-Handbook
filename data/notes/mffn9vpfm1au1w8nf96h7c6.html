<p><a aria-hidden="true" class="block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link" id="^dxpub7hs2rel" href="#^dxpub7hs2rel"></a>This is one of the best novels I have read recently. Initially it took me some time to get onboard. The frequent <em>sanskrit</em> names and references and a better vocabulary requirement kept me from turning pages but as I moved on from my inertia of reading thrillers, I fell in love with the narration. It torches light on why do we workship who we worship. Ram is an ideal man, it is very inherent to be practical or you know just stupid, but to be ideal is something that requires both courage and sacrifice. P.S. Sita is the best part of novel.</p>
