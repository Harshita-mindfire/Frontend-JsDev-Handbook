<ul>
<li>static: (default) not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.</li>
<li>relative: positioned relative to its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</li>
<li>fixed: An element with <code>position: fixed;</code> is positioned relative to the viewport,</li>
<li>absolute: An element with <code>position: absolute</code> is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).</li>
</ul>
<p>However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.</p>
<ul>
<li>sticky: An element with <code>position: sticky;</code> is positioned based on the user's scroll position.</li>
</ul>
