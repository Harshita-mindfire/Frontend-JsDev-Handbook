- Parallel routes allow you to **render multiple pages in parallel under different named slots** (routes) within a single layout
- They’re used when you want to render multiple views at once that are independent of each other but share layout structure.
- They’re defined in the app/ directory using the @slot naming convention.
- **slots are received as props in the layout**.
- the children prop is also a slot by default.

```graphql
app/
├── layout.js
├── @analytics/
│   └── page.js
├── @main/
│   └── page.js

```

if you're building:
- Modal-based routing
- Split-view dashboards
- Multi-panel layouts with deep linking
- Nested or partially refreshing UIs

then parallel routes are a cleaner, more powerful tool for structuring and scaling the app.

## Doubts clarification

🧩 1. Rendering Independence vs. Navigation Independence
You're right:

✅ Normal components won’t re-render if props/state don’t change.

BUT:

❌ Normal components live in the same route, so any route change will re-trigger the layout and all child components will re-render (or reload data, if they use useEffect, useRouter, or fetch() in getServerSideProps).

✅ Parallel routes let you navigate just one slot (e.g., side panel or modal) without re-rendering or affecting the rest of the page.
