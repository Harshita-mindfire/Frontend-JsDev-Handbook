<li><strong>Question</strong>
In nextjs, how does getStaticPath() returning {fallback: true} differ from getServerSideProps? Isn't both of them generate pages just in time? Why do we need getServerSideProps if fallback true does the exact same thing?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>While <code>{fallback: true}</code> and <code>getServerSideProps</code> both generate pages dynamically at runtime, they have some important differences that make them better suited for different use cases.</p>
<p>Firstly, <code>{fallback: true}</code> is typically used for generating pages for dynamic routes that have a large number of possible values, but only a small subset of those values are actually used frequently. In this case, it's not practical to pre-render all possible values at build-time because it would take too long or consume too much resources. Instead, using <code>{fallback: true}</code> allows you to pre-render only the most frequently used values at build-time, and generate the remaining pages on-demand at runtime. This can lead to faster build times and reduced resource usage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <code>getServerSideProps</code> is useful when you need to generate pages that require data that can't be pre-fetched at build-time. For example, if you have a page that shows real-time data or user-specific data, you can use <code>getServerSideProps</code> to fetch the necessary data at runtime and generate the page on the server-side. This ensures that the page always shows the most up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>getServerSideProps</code> gives you more control over the page generation process. With <code>{fallback: true}</code>, you have less control over the timing and order of page generation, and you can't do things like server-side rendering conditional content. With <code>getServerSideProps</code>, you have full control over the data fetching and rendering process, and can generate pages with more complex logic.</p>
<p>In summary, while <code>{fallback: true}</code> and <code>getServerSideProps</code> can both generate pages dynamically at runtime, they are better suited for different use cases. <code>{fallback: true}</code> is useful for generating pages for dynamic routes with a large number of possible values, while <code>getServerSideProps</code> is useful for generating pages that require real-time or user-specific data, or that have more complex rendering logic.</p>
