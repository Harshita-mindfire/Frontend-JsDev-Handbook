<ul>
<li>Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy from a relation or set of relations
There are various level of normalization. These are some of them:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>First Normal Form (1NF)</li>
<li>Second Normal Form (2NF)</li>
<li>Third Normal Form (3NF)</li>
<li>Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)</li>
<li>Fourth Normal Form (4NF)</li>
<li>Fifth Normal Form (5NF)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1nf">1NF<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1nf"></a></h3>
<p>First Normal Form (1NF):
If a relation contains a composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates the first normal form, or the relation is in first normal form if it does not contain any composite or multi-valued attribute. A relation is in first normal form if every attribute in that relation is singled valued attribute.</p>
<p>A table is in 1 NF if:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are only Single Valued Attributes.</li>
<li>Attribute Domain does not change.</li>
<li>There is a unique name for every Attribute/Column.</li>
<li>The order in which data is stored does not matter.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2nf">2NF<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2nf"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>full functional dependency</li>
</ul>
