## Summary 

The life of `Evelyn Hugo` is filled with scandal and fame. Over the course of her lifetime, she was married eight times to seven different husbands. Eighth time the charm, she secretly married the love of her life `Celia St James`, also an Oscar-winning actress. In an era prior to the acceptance of bisexuality, she was a bisexual. As she says herself, `I spent half my time loving her and half hiding how much I loved her.`. Evelyn, like any other human, made mistakes along the way. Although some of them were unforgivable, she believed she did what had to be done for her survival. She was suffering from `Breast Cancer` during her last days and wanted to come out of closet through her biography. She chose `Monique`, a struggling writer for `Vivane`(magazine) for writing her biography. A curious Monique wondered why Evelyn Hugo had chosen her out of all the writers. Evelyn asked Monique to justify her true character in the book. It was not in her interest to whitewash her actions.
