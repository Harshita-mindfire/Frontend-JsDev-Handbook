## for

```py
list = [1,2,3,4,5]
for x in list:
    print(x) 
```
>```result
1
2
3
4
5
```

```py
for y in range(10,15):
    print(y)
```
>```result
10
11
12
13
14
```

## while
```py
i = 0
while(i<5):
    i+=1
    print(i)
```
one else statement can also be added for the time the while fails
```py
i = 0
while(i<5):
    i+=1
    print(i)
else:
    print(f"i is now larger than or equal to five {i}")
```
